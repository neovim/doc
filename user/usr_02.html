			    The first steps in Vim


This chapter provides just enough information to edit a file with Vim.  Not
well or fast, but you can edit.  Take some time to practice with these
commands, they form the base for what follows.

Table of contents: |<A HREF="usr_toc.html">usr_toc.txt</A>|

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="02.1"></A><B>02.1</B>*	Running Vim for the First Time

To start Vim, enter this command:

<B>	gvim file.txt</B>

On Unix you can type this at any command prompt.  If you are running Windows,
open a command prompt <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A> and enter the command.  In either <A HREF="change.html#case">case</A>, Vim
starts editing a file called file.txt.  Because this is a new file, you get a
blank <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A>. This is what your screen will look like:

	+---------------------------------------+
	|#					|
	|~					|
	|~					|
	|~					|
	|~					|
	|&quot;file.txt&quot; [New file]			|
	+---------------------------------------+
		('#&quot; is the cursor position.)

The tilde (~) lines indicate lines not in the file.  In other words, when Vim
runs out of file to display, <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> displays tilde lines.  At the bottom of the
screen, a message line indicates the file is named file.txt and shows that you
are creating a new file.  The message information is temporary and other
information overwrites <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>.


THE VIM COMMAND

The gvim command causes the editor to create a new <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A> for editing.  If you
use this command:

<B>	vim file.txt</B>

the editing occurs inside your command <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A>.  In other words, if you are
running inside an xterm, the editor uses your xterm <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A>.  If you are using
the command prompt under Microsoft Windows, the editing occurs inside this
<A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A>.  The text in the <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A> will look the same for both versions, but with
gvim you have extra features, like a menu <A HREF="motion.html#bar">bar</A>.  More about that later.

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="02.2"></A><B>02.2</B>*	Inserting text

The Vim editor is a modal editor.  That means that the editor behaves
differently, depending on which mode you are in.  The two basic modes are
called <A HREF="intro.html#Normal">Normal</A> mode and <A HREF="insert.html#Insert">Insert</A> mode.  In <A HREF="intro.html#Normal">Normal</A> mode the characters you type
are commands.  In <A HREF="insert.html#Insert">Insert</A> mode the characters are inserted <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> text.
   Since you have just started Vim <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> will be in <A HREF="intro.html#Normal">Normal</A> mode.  To start <A HREF="insert.html#Insert">Insert</A>
mode you type the &quot;<A HREF="insert.html#i">i</A>&quot; command (i for <A HREF="insert.html#Insert">Insert</A>).  Then you can enter
the text.  It will be inserted into the file.  Do not worry if you make
mistakes; you can correct them later.  To enter the following programmer's
limerick, this is what you type:

<B>	iA very intelligent turtle</B>
<B>	Found programming Unix a hurdle</B>

After typing &quot;turtle&quot; you press the <A HREF="intro.html#&lt;Enter&gt;">&lt;Enter&gt;</A> key to start a new line.  Finally
you press the <A HREF="intro.html#&lt;Esc&gt;">&lt;Esc&gt;</A> key to stop <A HREF="insert.html#Insert">Insert</A> mode and go back to <A HREF="intro.html#Normal">Normal</A> mode.  You
now have two lines of text in your Vim <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A>:

	+---------------------------------------+
	|A very intelligent turtle		|
	|Found programming Unix a hurdle	|
	|~					|
	|~					|
	&#124;					|
	+---------------------------------------+


WHAT IS THE MODE?

To be able to see what mode you are in, type this command:

<B>	:set showmode</B>

You will notice that when typing the colon Vim moves the cursor to the last
line of the <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A>.  That's where you type colon commands (commands that start
with a colon).  Finish this command by pressing the <A HREF="intro.html#&lt;Enter&gt;">&lt;Enter&gt;</A> key (all commands
that start with a colon are finished this way).
   Now, if you type the &quot;<A HREF="insert.html#i">i</A>&quot; command Vim will display --INSERT-- at the bottom
of the <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A>.  This indicates you are in <A HREF="insert.html#Insert">Insert</A> mode.

	+---------------------------------------+
	|A very intelligent turtle		|
	|Found programming Unix a hurdle	|
	|~					|
	|~					|
	|-- INSERT <A HREF="starting.html#--">--</A>				|
	+---------------------------------------+

If you press <A HREF="intro.html#&lt;Esc&gt;">&lt;Esc&gt;</A> to go back to <A HREF="intro.html#Normal">Normal</A> mode the last line will be made blank.


GETTING OUT OF TROUBLE

One of the problems for Vim novices is mode confusion, which is caused by
forgetting which mode you are in or by accidentally typing a command that
switches modes.  To get back to <A HREF="intro.html#Normal">Normal</A> mode, no matter what mode you are in,
press the <A HREF="intro.html#&lt;Esc&gt;">&lt;Esc&gt;</A> key.  Sometimes you have to press <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> <A HREF="if_cscop.html#twice">twice</A>.  If Vim beeps back
at you, you already are in <A HREF="intro.html#Normal">Normal</A> mode.

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="02.3"></A><B>02.3</B>*	Moving around

After you return to <A HREF="intro.html#Normal">Normal</A> mode, you can move around by using these keys:


	<A HREF="motion.html#h">h</A>   left						*<A NAME="hjkl"></A><B>hjkl</B>*
	<A HREF="motion.html#j">j</A>   down
	<A HREF="motion.html#k">k</A>   up
	<A HREF="motion.html#l">l</A>   right

At first, <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> may appear that these commands were chosen at random.  After all,
who ever heard of using <A HREF="motion.html#l">l</A> for right?  But actually, there is a very good
reason for these choices: Moving the cursor is the most common thing you <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> in
an editor, and these keys are on the home row of your right hand.  In other
words, these commands are placed where you can type them the fastest
(especially when you type with ten fingers).

	Note:
	You can also move the cursor by using the arrow keys.  If you <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A>,
	however, you greatly slow down your editing because to press the arrow
	keys, you must move your hand from the text keys to the arrow keys.
	Considering that you might be doing <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> hundreds of times an hour, this
	can take a significant amount of time.
	   Also, there are keyboards which <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> not have arrow keys, or which
	locate them in unusual places; therefore, knowing the use of the <A HREF="#hjkl">hjkl</A>
	keys helps in those situations.

One way to remember these commands is that <A HREF="motion.html#h">h</A> is on the left, <A HREF="motion.html#l">l</A> is on the
right and <A HREF="motion.html#j">j</A> points down.  In a picture:

<B>		       k</B>
<B>		   h     l</B>
<B>		     j</B>

The best way to learn these commands is by using them.  Use the &quot;<A HREF="insert.html#i">i</A>&quot; command to
insert some more lines of text.  Then use the <A HREF="#hjkl">hjkl</A> keys to move around and
insert a <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A> somewhere.  Don't forget to press <A HREF="intro.html#&lt;Esc&gt;">&lt;Esc&gt;</A> to go back to <A HREF="intro.html#Normal">Normal</A>
mode.  |<A HREF="pi_tutor.html#:Tutor">:Tutor</A>| is also a nice way to learn by doing.

For <A HREF="mbyte.html#Japanese">Japanese</A> users, Hiroshi Iwatani suggested using this:

			Komsomolsk
			    ^
			    |
	   Huan Ho	&lt;--- ---&gt;  Los Angeles
	(Yellow river)	    |
			    <A HREF="visual.html#v">v</A>
			  Java (the island, not the programming language)

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="02.4"></A><B>02.4</B>*	Deleting characters

To delete a character, move the cursor over <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> and type &quot;<A HREF="change.html#x">x</A>&quot;.  (This is a
throwback to the old days of the typewriter, when you deleted things by typing
xxxx over them.)  Move the cursor to the beginning of the first line, for
example, and type xxxxxxx (seven x's) to delete &quot;A very &quot;.  The result should
look like this:

	+---------------------------------------+
	|intelligent turtle			|
	|Found programming Unix a hurdle	|
	|~					|
	|~					|
	&#124;					|
	+---------------------------------------+

Now you can insert new text, for example by typing:

<B>	iA young &lt;Esc&gt;</B>

This begins an insert (the <A HREF="motion.html#i)">i)</A>, inserts the words &quot;A young&quot;, and then exits
insert mode (the final <A HREF="intro.html#&lt;Esc&gt;">&lt;Esc&gt;</A>).	The result:

	+---------------------------------------+
	|A young intelligent turtle		|
	|Found programming Unix a hurdle	|
	|~					|
	|~					|
	&#124;					|
	+---------------------------------------+


DELETING A LINE

To delete a whole line use the &quot;<A HREF="change.html#dd">dd</A>&quot; command.  The following line will
then move up to fill the gap:

	+---------------------------------------+
	|Found programming Unix a hurdle	|
	|~					|
	|~					|
	|~					|
	&#124;					|
	+---------------------------------------+


DELETING A LINE BREAK

In Vim you can join two lines together, which means that the line break
between them is deleted.  The &quot;<A HREF="change.html#J">J</A>&quot; command does this.
   Take these two lines:

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	A young intelligent </FONT></B>
<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	turtle </FONT></B>

Move the cursor to the first line and press &quot;<A HREF="change.html#J">J</A>&quot;:

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	A young intelligent turtle </FONT></B>

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="02.5"></A><B>02.5</B>*	Undo and Redo

Suppose you delete too much.  Well, you can type <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> in again, but an easier
way exists.  The &quot;<A HREF="undo.html#u">u</A>&quot; command undoes the last edit.  Take a look at this in
action: After using &quot;<A HREF="change.html#dd">dd</A>&quot; to delete the first line, &quot;<A HREF="undo.html#u">u</A>&quot; brings <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> back.
   Another one: Move the cursor to the A in the first line:

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	A young intelligent turtle </FONT></B>

Now type xxxxxxx to delete &quot;A young&quot;.  The result is <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> follows:

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	 intelligent turtle </FONT></B>

Type &quot;<A HREF="undo.html#u">u</A>&quot; to <A HREF="undo.html#undo">undo</A> the last delete.  That delete removed the <A HREF="motion.html#g,">g,</A> so the <A HREF="undo.html#undo">undo</A>
restores the character.

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	g intelligent turtle </FONT></B>

The next <A HREF="undo.html#u">u</A> command restores the next-to-last character deleted:

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	ng intelligent turtle </FONT></B>

The next <A HREF="undo.html#u">u</A> command gives you the <A HREF="undo.html#u">u</A>, and so on:

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	ung intelligent turtle </FONT></B>
<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	oung intelligent turtle </FONT></B>
<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	young intelligent turtle </FONT></B>
<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	 young intelligent turtle </FONT></B>
<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	A young intelligent turtle </FONT></B>

REDO

If you <A HREF="undo.html#undo">undo</A> too many times, you can press <A HREF="undo.html#CTRL-R">CTRL-R</A> (redo) to reverse the
preceding command.  In other words, <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> undoes the <A HREF="undo.html#undo">undo</A>.  To see this in
action, press <A HREF="undo.html#CTRL-R">CTRL-R</A> <A HREF="if_cscop.html#twice">twice</A>.  The character A and the space after <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> disappear:

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	young intelligent turtle </FONT></B>

There's a special version of the <A HREF="undo.html#undo">undo</A> command, the &quot;<A HREF="undo.html#U">U</A>&quot; (undo line) command.
The <A HREF="undo.html#undo">undo</A> line command undoes all the changes made on the last line that was
edited.  Typing this command <A HREF="if_cscop.html#twice">twice</A> cancels the preceding &quot;<A HREF="undo.html#U">U</A>&quot;.

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	A very intelligent turtle </FONT></B>
	  xxxx				Delete very

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	A intelligent turtle </FONT></B>
		      xxxxxx		Delete turtle

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	A intelligent </FONT></B>
					Restore line with &quot;<A HREF="undo.html#U">U</A>&quot;
<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	A very intelligent turtle </FONT></B>
					Undo &quot;<A HREF="undo.html#U">U</A>&quot; with &quot;<A HREF="undo.html#u">u</A>&quot;
<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	A intelligent </FONT></B>

The &quot;<A HREF="undo.html#U">U</A>&quot; command is a change by itself, which the &quot;<A HREF="undo.html#u">u</A>&quot; command undoes and <A HREF="undo.html#CTRL-R">CTRL-R</A>
redoes.  This might be a bit confusing.  Don't worry, with &quot;<A HREF="undo.html#u">u</A>&quot; and <A HREF="undo.html#CTRL-R">CTRL-R</A> you
can go to any of the situations you had.  More about that in section |<A HREF="usr_32.html#32.2">32.2</A>|.

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="02.6"></A><B>02.6</B>*	Other editing commands

Vim has a large number of commands to change the text.  See |<A HREF="quickref.html#Q_in">Q_in</A>| and below.
Here are a few often used ones.


APPENDING

The &quot;<A HREF="insert.html#i">i</A>&quot; command inserts a character before the character under the cursor.
That works fine; but what happens if you want to add stuff to the end of the
line?  For that you need to insert text after the cursor.  This is done with
the &quot;<A HREF="insert.html#a">a</A>&quot; (append) command.
   For example, to change the line

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	and that's not saying much for the turtle. </FONT></B>
to
<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	and that's not saying much for the turtle!!! </FONT></B>

move the cursor over to the dot at the end of the line. Then type &quot;<A HREF="change.html#x">x</A>&quot; to
delete the period.  The cursor is now positioned at the end of the line on the
<A HREF="motion.html#e">e</A> in turtle.  Now type

<B>	a!!!&lt;Esc&gt;</B>

to append three exclamation points after the <A HREF="motion.html#e">e</A> in turtle:

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	and that's not saying much for the turtle!!! </FONT></B>


OPENING UP A NEW LINE

The &quot;<A HREF="insert.html#o">o</A>&quot; command creates a new, empty line below the cursor and puts Vim in
<A HREF="insert.html#Insert">Insert</A> mode.  Then you can type the text for the new line.
   Suppose the cursor is somewhere in the first of these two lines:

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	A very intelligent turtle </FONT></B>
<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	Found programming Unix a hurdle </FONT></B>

If you now use the &quot;<A HREF="insert.html#o">o</A>&quot; command and type new text:

<B>	oThat liked using Vim&lt;Esc&gt;</B>

The result is:

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	A very intelligent turtle </FONT></B>
<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	That liked using Vim </FONT></B>
<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	Found programming Unix a hurdle </FONT></B>

The &quot;<A HREF="insert.html#O">O</A>&quot; command (uppercase) opens a line above the cursor.


USING A COUNT

Suppose you want to move up nine lines.  You can type &quot;kkkkkkkkk&quot; or you can
enter the command &quot;9k&quot;.  In fact, you can precede many commands with a number.
Earlier in this chapter, for instance, you added three exclamation points to
the end of a line by typing &quot;a!!!&lt;Esc&gt;&quot;.  Another way to <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> this is to use the
command &quot;3a!&lt;Esc&gt;&quot;.  The <A HREF="intro.html#count">count</A> of 3 tells the command that follows to triple
its effect.  Similarly, to delete three characters, use the command &quot;3x&quot;.  The
<A HREF="intro.html#count">count</A> always comes before the command <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> applies to.

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="02.7"></A><B>02.7</B>*	Getting out

To exit, use the &quot;<A HREF="editing.html#ZZ">ZZ</A>&quot; command.  This command writes the file and exits.

	Note:
	Unlike many other editors, Vim does not automatically make a <A HREF="editing.html#backup">backup</A>
	file.  If you type &quot;<A HREF="editing.html#ZZ">ZZ</A>&quot;, your changes are committed and there's no
	turning back.  You can configure the Vim editor to produce <A HREF="editing.html#backup">backup</A>
	files, see |<A HREF="usr_07.html#07.4">07.4</A>|.


DISCARDING CHANGES

Sometimes you will make a sequence of changes and suddenly realize you were
better off before you started.  Not to worry; Vim has a
quit-and-throw-things-away command.  It is:

<B>	:q!</B>

Don't forget to press <A HREF="intro.html#&lt;Enter&gt;">&lt;Enter&gt;</A> to finish the command.

For those of you interested in the details, the three parts of this command
are the colon (:), which enters <A HREF="cmdline.html#Command-line">Command-line</A> mode; the <A HREF="repeat.html#q">q</A> command, which tells
the editor to quit; and the override command modifier (!).
   The override command modifier is needed because Vim is reluctant to throw
away changes.  If you were to just type &quot;<A HREF="editing.html#:q">:q</A>&quot;, Vim would display an error
message and refuse to exit:

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	E37: No write since last change (use ! to override) </FONT></B>

By specifying the override, you are in effect telling Vim, &quot;<A HREF="insert.html#I">I</A> know that what
I'm doing looks stupid, but I'm a big boy and really want to <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> this.&quot;

If you want to continue editing with Vim: The &quot;:e!&quot; command reloads the
original version of the file.

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="02.8"></A><B>02.8</B>*	Finding help

Everything you always wanted to know can be found in the Vim help files.
Don't be afraid to ask!

If you know what you are looking for, <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> is usually easier to search for <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>
using the help system, instead of using Google.  Because the subjects follow
a certain style guide.

Also the help has the advantage of belonging to your particular Vim version.
You won't see help for commands added later.  These would not work for you.

To get generic help use this command:

<B>	:help</B>

You could also use the first function key <A HREF="helphelp.html#&lt;F1&gt;">&lt;F1&gt;</A>.  If your keyboard has a <A HREF="helphelp.html#&lt;Help&gt;">&lt;Help&gt;</A>
key <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> might work <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> well.
   If you don't supply a subject, &quot;<A HREF="helphelp.html#:help">:help</A>&quot; displays the general help <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A>.
The creators of Vim did something very clever (or very lazy) with the help
system: They made the help <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A> a normal editing <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A>.  You can use all
the normal Vim commands to move through the help information.  Therefore <A HREF="motion.html#h">h</A>, <A HREF="motion.html#j">j</A>,
<A HREF="motion.html#k">k</A>, and <A HREF="motion.html#l">l</A> move left, down, up and right.
   To get out of the help <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A>, use the same command you use to get out of
the editor: &quot;<A HREF="editing.html#ZZ">ZZ</A>&quot;.  This will only close the help <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A>, not exit Vim.

As you read the help text, you will notice some text enclosed in vertical <A HREF="index.html#bars">bars</A>
(for example, |<A HREF="helphelp.html#help">help</A>|).  This indicates a hyperlink.  If you position the
cursor anywhere between the <A HREF="index.html#bars">bars</A> and press <A HREF="tagsrch.html#CTRL-]">CTRL-]</A> (jump to tag), the help
system takes you to the indicated subject.  (For reasons not discussed here,
the Vim terminology for a hyperlink is <A HREF="tagsrch.html#tag">tag</A>.  So <A HREF="tagsrch.html#CTRL-]">CTRL-]</A> jumps to the location
of the <A HREF="tagsrch.html#tag">tag</A> given by the <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A> under the cursor.)
   After a few jumps, you might want to go back.  <A HREF="tagsrch.html#CTRL-T">CTRL-T</A> (pop <A HREF="tagsrch.html#tag">tag</A>) takes you
back to the preceding position.  <A HREF="motion.html#CTRL-O">CTRL-O</A> (jump to older position) also works
nicely here.
   At the top of the help screen, there is the <A HREF="intro.html#notation">notation</A> *help.txt*.  This name
between &quot;*&quot; characters is used by the help system to define a <A HREF="tagsrch.html#tag">tag</A> (hyperlink
destination).
   See |<A HREF="usr_29.html#29.1">29.1</A>| for details about using <A HREF="tagsrch.html#tags">tags</A>.

To get help on a given subject, use the following command:

<B>	:help {subject}</B>

To get help on the &quot;<A HREF="change.html#x">x</A>&quot; command, for example, enter the following:

<B>	:help x</B>

To find out how to delete text, use this command:

<B>	:help deleting</B>

To get a complete index of all Vim commands, use the following command:

<B>	:help index</B>

When you need to get help for a <A HREF="intro.html#control">control</A> character command (for example,
CTRL-A), you need to <A HREF="spell.html#spell">spell</A> <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> with the prefix &quot;CTRL-&quot;.

<B>	:help CTRL-A</B>

The Vim editor has many different modes.  By default, the help system displays
the normal-mode commands.  For example, the following command displays help
for the normal-mode <A HREF="motion.html#CTRL-H">CTRL-H</A> command:

<B>	:help CTRL-H</B>

To identify other modes, use a mode prefix.  If you want the help for the
insert-mode version of a command, use &quot;i_&quot;.  For <A HREF="motion.html#CTRL-H">CTRL-H</A> this gives you the
following command:

<B>	:help i_CTRL-H</B>

When you start the Vim editor, you can use several command-line arguments.
These all begin with a dash (-).  To find what the <A HREF="starting.html#-t">-t</A> argument does, for
example, use the command:

<B>	:help -t</B>

The Vim editor has a number of <A HREF="options.html#options">options</A> that enable you to configure and
customize the editor.  If you want help for an option, you need to enclose <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>
in single quotation marks.  To find out what the <A HREF="options.html#'number'">'number'</A> option does, for
example, use the following command:

<B>	:help 'number'</B>

The table with all mode prefixes can be found below: |<A HREF="#help-summary">help-summary</A>|.

Special keys are enclosed in angle brackets.  To find help on the up-arrow key
in <A HREF="insert.html#Insert">Insert</A> mode, for instance, use this command:

<B>	:help i_&lt;Up&gt;</B>

If you see an error message that you don't understand, for example:

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	E37: No write since last change (use ! to override) </FONT></B>

You can use the error ID at the start to find help about <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>:

<B>	:help E37</B>



Summary: 					*<A NAME="help-summary"></A><B>help-summary</B>* 

1) Use Ctrl-D after typing a topic and let Vim show all available topics.
   Or press <A HREF="intro.html#Tab">Tab</A> to complete:
<B>    	:help some&lt;Tab&gt;</B>
    More information on how to use the help:
<B>	:help helphelp</B>

2) Follow the links in <A HREF="index.html#bars">bars</A> to related help.  You can go from the detailed
   help to the user documentation, which describes certain commands more from
   a user perspective and <A HREF="various.html#less">less</A> detailed.  E.g. after:
<B>   	:help pattern.txt</B>
    You can see the user guide topics |<A HREF="usr_03.html#03.9">03.9</A>| and |<A HREF="usr_27.html">usr_27.txt</A>| in the
   introduction.

3) Options are enclosed in single apostrophes.  To go to the help topic for the
   <A HREF="eval.html#list">list</A> option:
<B>	:help 'list'</B>
    If you only know you are looking for a certain option, you can also <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A>:
<B>	:help options.txt</B>
    to open the help page which describes all option handling and then search
   using regular expressions, e.g. textwidth.
   Certain <A HREF="options.html#options">options</A> have their own namespace, e.g.:
<B>   	:help cpo-&lt;letter&gt;</B>
    for the corresponding flag of the <A HREF="options.html#'cpoptions'">'cpoptions'</A> settings, substitute &lt;letter&gt;
   by a specific flag, e.g.:
<B>  	:help cpo-;</B>
    And for the guioption flags:
<B>  	:help go-&lt;letter&gt;</B>

4) <A HREF="intro.html#Normal">Normal</A> mode commands <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> not have a prefix. To go to the help page for the
   &quot;<A HREF="tabpage.html#gt">gt</A>&quot; command:
<B>   	:help gt</B>

5) <A HREF="insert.html#Insert">Insert</A> mode commands start with i_.  Help for <A HREF="change.html#deleting">deleting</A> a <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A>:
<B>   	:help i_CTRL-W</B>

6) <A HREF="visual.html#Visual">Visual</A> mode commands start with v_.  Help for jumping to the other side of
   the <A HREF="visual.html#Visual">Visual</A> area:
<B>   	:help v_o</B>

7) Command line editing and arguments start with c_.  Help for using the
   command argument <A HREF="motion.html#&#37;">&#37;</A>:
<B>   	:help c_%</B>

8) Ex-commands always start with &quot;<A HREF="cmdline.html#:">:</A>&quot;, so to go to the <A HREF="change.html#:s">:s</A> command help:
<B>	:help :s</B>

9) Commands specifically for debugging start with &quot;<A HREF="change.html#&gt;">&gt;</A>&quot;.  To go to to the help
   for the &quot;cont&quot; debug command:
<B>	:help &gt;cont</B>

10) Key combinations.  They usually start with a single <A HREF="print.html#letter">letter</A> indicating
    the mode for which they can be used.  E.g.:
<B>   	:help i_CTRL-X</B>
     takes you to the family of Ctrl-X commands for insert mode which can be
    used to auto complete different things.  Note, that certain keys will
    always be written the same, e.g. Control will always be CTRL.
    For normal mode commands there is no prefix and the topic is available at
    <A HREF="helphelp.html#:h">:h</A> CTRL-&lt;Letter&gt;. E.g. 
<B>   	:help CTRL-W</B>
     In contrast
<B>	:help c_CTRL-R</B>
     will describe what the Ctrl-R does when entering commands in the Command
    line and
<B>   	:help v_Ctrl-A</B>
     talks about incrementing numbers in visual mode and
<B>	:help g_CTRL-A</B>
     talks about the g&lt;C-A&gt; command (e.g. you have to press &quot;<A HREF="vimindex.html#g">g</A>&quot; then &lt;Ctrl-A&gt;).
    Here the &quot;<A HREF="vimindex.html#g">g</A>&quot; stand for the normal command &quot;<A HREF="vimindex.html#g">g</A>&quot; which always expects a second
    key before doing something similar to the commands starting with &quot;<A HREF="vimindex.html#z">z</A>&quot;

11) Regexp items always start with <A HREF="pattern.html#/.">/.</A>  So to get help for the &quot;\+&quot; quantifier
    in Vim regexes:
<B>   	:help /\+</B>
     If you need to know everything about regular expressions, start reading
    at:
<B>   	:help pattern.txt</B>

12) Registers always start with &quot;<A HREF="change.html#quote">quote</A>&quot;. To find out about the special &quot;<A HREF="cmdline.html#:">:</A>&quot;
    <A HREF="sponsor.html#register">register</A>:
<B>   	:help quote:</B>

13) Vim Script (VimL) is available at
<B>	:help eval.txt</B>
    Certain aspects of the language are available at <A HREF="helphelp.html#:h">:h</A> expr-X where &quot;<A HREF="change.html#X">X</A>&quot; is a
   single <A HREF="print.html#letter">letter</A>. E.g. 
<B>   	:help expr-!</B>
    will take you to the topic describing the &quot;<A HREF="change.html#!">!</A>&quot; (Not) <A HREF="motion.html#operator">operator</A> for
   VimScript.
   Also important is
<B>   	:help function-list</B>
    to find a short description of all <A HREF="eval.html#functions">functions</A> available.  Help topics for
   VimL <A HREF="eval.html#functions">functions</A> always include the &quot;()&quot;, so:
<B>   	:help append()</B>
    talks about the append VimL function rather than how to append text in the
   current buffer.

14) Mappings are talked about in the help page <A HREF="helphelp.html#:h">:h</A> |<A HREF="map.html">map.txt</A>|. Use
<B>    	:help mapmode-i</B>
     to find out about the |<A HREF="map.html#:imap">:imap</A>| command.  Also use :map-topic
    to find out about certain subtopics particular for mappings.  e.g:
<B>    	:help :map-local</B>
     for buffer-local mappings or
<B>	:help map-bar</B>
     for how the '&#124;' is handled in mappings.

15) Command <A HREF="intro.html#definitions">definitions</A> are talked about <A HREF="helphelp.html#:h">:h</A> command-topic, so use
<B>	:help command-bar</B>
     to find out about the '<A HREF="change.html#!">!</A>' argument for custom commands.

16) Window management commands always start with <A HREF="vimindex.html#CTRL-W">CTRL-W</A>, so you find the
    corresponding help at <A HREF="helphelp.html#:h">:h</A> CTRL-W_letter.  E.g.
<B>   	:help CTRL-W_p</B>
     for moving the previous accessed <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A>.  You can also access
<B>	:help windows.txt</B>
     and read your way through if you are looking for <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A> handling
    commands.

17) Use |<A HREF="helphelp.html#:helpgrep">:helpgrep</A>| to search in all help pages (and also of any installed
    plugins).  See |<A HREF="helphelp.html#:helpgrep">:helpgrep</A>| for how to use <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>.
    To search for a topic:
<B>    	:helpgrep topic</B>
     This takes you to the first match.  To go to the next one:
<B>	:cnext</B>
     All matches are available in the <A HREF="quickfix.html#quickfix">quickfix</A> <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A> which can be opened
    with:
<B>    	:copen</B>
     Move around to the match you like and press Enter to jump to that help.

18) The user manual.  This describes help topics for beginners in a rather
    friendly way.  Start at |<A HREF="usr_toc.html">usr_toc.txt</A>| to find the table of content (as you
    might have guessed):
<B>    	:help usr_toc.txt</B>
     Skim over the contents to find interesting topics. The &quot;<A HREF="digraph.html#Digraphs">Digraphs</A>&quot; and
    &quot;Entering special characters&quot; items are in chapter 24, so to go to that
    particular help page:
<B>    	:help usr_24.txt</B>
     Also if you want to access a certain chapter in the help, the chapter
    number can be accessed directly like this:
<B>    	:help 10.1</B>
     goes to chapter <A HREF="usr_10.html#10.1">10.1</A> in |<A HREF="usr_10.html">usr_10.txt</A>| and talks about <A HREF="repeat.html#recording">recording</A> macros.

19) Highlighting groups.  Always start with hl-groupname.  E.g.
<B>    	:help hl-WarningMsg</B>
     talks about the WarningMsg highlighting group.

20) <A HREF="autocmd.html#Syntax">Syntax</A> highlighting is namespaced to :syn-topic e.g.
<B>	:help :syn-conceal</B>
     talks about the <A HREF="syntax.html#conceal">conceal</A> argument for the <A HREF="syntax.html#:syn">:syn</A> command.

21) <A HREF="quickfix.html#Quickfix">Quickfix</A> commands usually start with <A HREF="change.html#:c">:c</A> while location <A HREF="eval.html#list">list</A> commands
    usually start with <A HREF="various.html#:l">:l</A>

22) Autocommand events can be found by their name:
<B>     	:help BufWinLeave</B>
     To see all possible events:
<B>	:help autocommands-events</B>

23) <A HREF="cmdline.html#Command-line">Command-line</A> switches always start with &quot;<A HREF="motion.html#-">-</A>&quot;.  So for the help of the -f
    command switch of Vim use:
<B>    	:help -f</B>

24) Optional features always start with &quot;<A HREF="motion.html#+">+</A>&quot;.  To find out about the
    <A HREF="syntax.html#conceal">conceal</A> feature use:
<B>    	:help +conceal</B>

25) Documentation for included <A HREF="filetype.html#filetype">filetype</A> specific functionality is usually
    available  in the form ft-&lt;filetype&gt;-&lt;functionality&gt;.  So
<B>    	:help ft-c-syntax</B>
     talks about the C <A HREF="syntax.html#syntax">syntax</A> file and the option <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> provides.  Sometimes,
    additional sections for omni completion
<B>    	:help ft-php-omni</B>
     or <A HREF="filetype.html#filetype">filetype</A> plugins
<B>	:help ft-tex-plugin</B>
     are available.

26) Error and Warning codes can be looked up directly in the help.  So
<B>	:help E297</B>
     takes you exactly to the description of the swap error message and
<B>	:help W10</B>
     talks about the warning &quot;Changing a readonly file&quot;.
    Sometimes however, those error codes are not described, but rather are
    listed at the Vim command that usually causes this.  So:
<B>    	:help E128</B>
     takes you to the |<A HREF="eval.html#:function">:function</A>| command
