You can find an introduction on <A HREF="#folding">folding</A> in chapter 28 of the user manual.

{not available when compiled without the |<A HREF="various.html#+folding">+folding</A>| feature}

==============================================================================

1. Fold methods					*<A NAME="fold-methods"></A><B>fold-methods</B>*

The <A HREF="#folding">folding</A> method can be set with the <A HREF="options.html#'foldmethod'">'foldmethod'</A> option.

When setting <A HREF="options.html#'foldmethod'">'foldmethod'</A> to a value other than &quot;manual&quot;, all <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> are
deleted and new ones created.  Switching to the &quot;manual&quot; method doesn't remove
the existing <A HREF="#folds">folds</A>.  This can be used to first define the <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> automatically
and then change them manually.

There are six methods to select <A HREF="#folds">folds</A>:
	manual		manually define <A HREF="#folds">folds</A>
	indent		more indent means a higher fold level
	<A HREF="eval.html#expr">expr</A>		specify an <A HREF="eval.html#expression">expression</A> to define <A HREF="#folds">folds</A>
	<A HREF="syntax.html#syntax">syntax</A>		<A HREF="#folds">folds</A> defined by <A HREF="syntax.html#syntax">syntax</A> highlighting
	<A HREF="diff.html#diff">diff</A>		<A HREF="#folds">folds</A> for unchanged text
	marker		<A HREF="#folds">folds</A> defined by markers in the text



MANUAL						*<A NAME="fold-manual"></A><B>fold-manual</B>*

Use commands to manually define the fold regions.  This can also be used by a
<A HREF="usr_41.html#script">script</A> that parses text to find <A HREF="#folds">folds</A>.

The level of a fold is only defined by its nesting.  To increase the fold
level of a fold for a range of lines, define a fold inside <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> that has the
same lines.

The manual <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> are lost when you <A HREF="editing.html#abandon">abandon</A> the file.  To save the <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> use
the |<A HREF="starting.html#:mkview">:mkview</A>| command.  The view can be restored later with |<A HREF="starting.html#:loadview">:loadview</A>|.



INDENT						*<A NAME="fold-indent"></A><B>fold-indent</B>*

The <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> are automatically defined by the indent of the lines.

The foldlevel is computed from the indent of the line, divided by the
<A HREF="options.html#'shiftwidth'">'shiftwidth'</A> (rounded down).  A sequence of lines with the same or higher fold
level form a fold, with the lines with a higher level forming a nested fold.

The nesting of <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> is limited with <A HREF="options.html#'foldnestmax'">'foldnestmax'</A>.

Some lines are ignored and get the fold level of the line above or below <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>,
whichever is lower.  These are empty or white lines and lines starting
with a character in <A HREF="options.html#'foldignore'">'foldignore'</A>.  White space is skipped before checking for
characters in <A HREF="options.html#'foldignore'">'foldignore'</A>.  For C use &quot;<A HREF="pattern.html##">#</A>&quot; to ignore preprocessor lines.

When you want to ignore lines in another way, use the '<A HREF="eval.html#expr">expr</A>' method.  The
|<A HREF="eval.html#indent()">indent()</A>| function can be used in <A HREF="options.html#'foldexpr'">'foldexpr'</A> to get the indent of a line.



EXPR						*<A NAME="fold-expr"></A><B>fold-expr</B>*

The <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> are automatically defined by their foldlevel, like with the &quot;indent&quot;
method.  The value of the <A HREF="options.html#'foldexpr'">'foldexpr'</A> option is evaluated to get the foldlevel
of a line.  Examples:
This will create a fold for all consecutive lines that start with a <A HREF="intro.html#tab">tab</A>:
<B>	:set foldexpr=getline(v:lnum)[0]==\"\\t\"</B>
This will call a function to compute the fold level:
<B>	:set foldexpr=MyFoldLevel(v:lnum)</B>
This will make a fold out of paragraphs separated by blank lines:
<B>	:set foldexpr=getline(v:lnum)=~'^\\s*$'&amp;&amp;getline(v:lnum+1)=~'\\S'?'&lt;1':1</B>
this does the same:
<B>	:set foldexpr=getline(v:lnum-1)=~'^\\s*$'&amp;&amp;getline(v:lnum)=~'\\S'?'&gt;1':1</B>

Note that backslashes must be used to <A HREF="intro.html#escape">escape</A> characters that &quot;<A HREF="options.html#:set">:set</A>&quot; handles
differently (space, backslash, double <A HREF="change.html#quote">quote</A>, etc., see |<A HREF="options.html#option-backslash">option-backslash</A>|).

These are the conditions with which the <A HREF="eval.html#expression">expression</A> is evaluated:
- The current buffer and <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A> are set for the line.
- The variable &quot;<A HREF="eval.html#v:lnum">v:lnum</A>&quot; is set to the line number.
- The result is used for the fold level in this way:
<B><FONT color="#54A23D">  value			meaning </FONT></B>
  0			the line is not in a fold
  1, 2, ..		the line is in a fold with this level
  -1			the fold level is undefined, use the fold level of a
			line before or after this line, whichever is the
			lowest.
  &quot;<A HREF="change.html#=">=</A>&quot;			use fold level from the previous line
  &quot;a1&quot;, &quot;a2&quot;, ..	add one, two, .. to the fold level of the previous
			line
  &quot;s1&quot;, &quot;s2&quot;, ..	subtract one, two, .. from the fold level of the
			previous line
  &quot;&lt;1&quot;, &quot;&lt;2&quot;, ..	a fold with this level ends at this line
  &quot;&gt;1&quot;, &quot;&gt;2&quot;, ..	a fold with this level starts at this line

It is not required to <A HREF="motion.html#mark">mark</A> the start (end) of a fold with &quot;&gt;1&quot; (&quot;&lt;1&quot;), a fold
will also start (end) when the fold level is higher (lower) than the fold
level of the previous line.

There must be no side effects from the <A HREF="eval.html#expression">expression</A>.  The text in the buffer,
cursor position, the search patterns, <A HREF="options.html#options">options</A> etc. must not be changed.
You can change and restore them if you are careful.

If there is some error in the <A HREF="eval.html#expression">expression</A>, or the resulting value isn't
recognized, there is no error message and the fold level will be zero.
For debugging the <A HREF="options.html#'debug'">'debug'</A> option can be set to &quot;msg&quot;, the error <A HREF="message.html#messages">messages</A> will
be visible then.

Note: Since the <A HREF="eval.html#expression">expression</A> has to be evaluated for every line, this fold
method can be very slow!

Try to avoid the &quot;<A HREF="change.html#=">=</A>&quot;, &quot;<A HREF="insert.html#a">a</A>&quot; and &quot;<A HREF="change.html#s">s</A>&quot; return values, since Vim often has to search
backwards for a line for which the fold level is defined.  This can be slow.

|<A HREF="eval.html#foldlevel()">foldlevel()</A>| can be useful to compute a fold level relative to a previous
fold level.  But note that <A HREF="eval.html#foldlevel()">foldlevel()</A> may return -1 if the level is not known
yet.  And <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> returns the level at the start of the line, while a fold might
end in that line.

It may happened that <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> are not updated properly.  You can use |<A HREF="#zx">zx</A>| or |<A HREF="#zX">zX</A>|
to force updating <A HREF="#folds">folds</A>.



SYNTAX						*<A NAME="fold-syntax"></A><B>fold-syntax</B>*

A fold is defined by <A HREF="syntax.html#syntax">syntax</A> items that have the &quot;fold&quot; argument. |<A HREF="syntax.html#:syn-fold">:syn-fold</A>|

The fold level is defined by nesting <A HREF="#folds">folds</A>.  The nesting of <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> is limited
with <A HREF="options.html#'foldnestmax'">'foldnestmax'</A>.

Be careful to specify proper <A HREF="syntax.html#syntax">syntax</A> syncing.  If this is not done right, <A HREF="#folds">folds</A>
may differ from the displayed highlighting.  This is especially relevant when
using patterns that match more than one line.  In <A HREF="change.html#case">case</A> of doubt, try using
brute-force syncing:
<B>	:syn sync fromstart</B>



DIFF						*<A NAME="fold-diff"></A><B>fold-diff</B>*

The <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> are automatically defined for text that is not part of a change or
close to a change.

This method only works properly when the <A HREF="options.html#'diff'">'diff'</A> option is set for the current
<A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A> and changes are being displayed.  Otherwise the whole buffer will be
one big fold.

The <A HREF="options.html#'diffopt'">'diffopt'</A> option can be used to specify the context.  That is, the number
of lines between the fold and a change that are not included in the fold.  For
example, to use a context of 8 lines:
<B>	:set diffopt=filler,context:8</B>
The default context is six lines.

When <A HREF="options.html#'scrollbind'">'scrollbind'</A> is also set, Vim will attempt to keep the same <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> open in
other <A HREF="diff.html#diff">diff</A> <A HREF="windows.html#windows">windows</A>, so that the same text is visible.



MARKER						*<A NAME="fold-marker"></A><B>fold-marker</B>*

Markers in the text tell where <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> start and end.  This allows you to
precisely specify the <A HREF="#folds">folds</A>.  This will allow <A HREF="change.html#deleting">deleting</A> and putting a fold,
without the risk of including the wrong lines.  The <A HREF="options.html#'foldtext'">'foldtext'</A> option is
normally set such that the text before the marker shows up in the folded line.
This makes <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> possible to give a name to the fold.

Markers can have a level included, or can use matching pairs.  Including a
level is easier, you don't have to add end markers and avoid problems with
non-matching marker pairs.  Example:
<B>	/* global variables {{{1 */</B>
<B>	int varA, varB;</B>

<B>	/* functions {{{1 */</B>
<B>	/* funcA() {{{2 */</B>
<B>	void funcA() {}</B>

<B>	/* funcB() {{{2 */</B>
<B>	void funcB() {}</B>

A fold starts at a &quot;{{{&quot; marker.  The following number specifies the fold
level.  What happens depends on the difference between the current fold level
and the level given by the marker:
1. If a marker with the same fold level is encountered, the previous fold
   ends and another fold with the same level starts.
2. If a marker with a higher fold level is found, a nested fold is started.
3. if a marker with a lower fold level is found, all <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> up to and including
   this level end and a fold with the specified level starts.

The number indicates the fold level.  A zero cannot be used (a marker with
level zero is ignored).  You can use &quot;}}}&quot; with a digit to indicate the level
of the fold that ends.  The fold level of the following line will be one <A HREF="various.html#less">less</A>
than the indicated level.  Note that Vim doesn't look back to the level of the
matching marker (that would take too much time).  Example:

<B>	{{{1</B>
<B>	fold level here is 1</B>
<B>	{{{3</B>
<B>	fold level here is 3</B>
<B>	}}}3</B>
<B>	fold level here is 2</B>

You can also use matching pairs of &quot;{{{&quot; and &quot;}}}&quot; markers to define <A HREF="#folds">folds</A>.
Each &quot;{{{&quot; increases the fold level by one, each &quot;}}}&quot; decreases the fold
level by one.  Be careful to keep the markers matching!  Example:

<B>	{{{</B>
<B>	fold level here is 1</B>
<B>	{{{</B>
<B>	fold level here is 2</B>
<B>	}}}</B>
<B>	fold level here is 1</B>

You can mix using markers with a number and without a number.  A useful way of
doing this is to use numbered markers for large <A HREF="#folds">folds</A>, and unnumbered markers
locally in a function.  For example use level one <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> for the sections of
your file like &quot;structure definitions&quot;, &quot;local variables&quot; and &quot;<A HREF="eval.html#functions">functions</A>&quot;.
Use level 2 markers for each definition and function,  Use unnumbered markers
inside <A HREF="eval.html#functions">functions</A>.  When you make changes in a function to split up <A HREF="#folds">folds</A>, you
don't have to renumber the markers.

The markers can be set with the <A HREF="options.html#'foldmarker'">'foldmarker'</A> option.  It is recommended to
keep this at the default value of &quot;{{{,}}}&quot;, so that files can be exchanged
between Vim users.  Only change <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> when <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> is required for the file (e.g., <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>
contains markers from another <A HREF="#folding">folding</A> editor, or the default markers cause
trouble for the language of the file).


							*<A NAME="fold-create-marker"></A><B>fold-create-marker</B>*
&quot;<A HREF="#zf">zf</A>&quot; can be used to create a fold defined by markers.  Vim will insert the
markers for you.  Vim will append the start and end marker, <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> specified with
<A HREF="options.html#'foldmarker'">'foldmarker'</A>.  The markers are appended to the end of the line.
<A HREF="options.html#'commentstring'">'commentstring'</A> is used if <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> isn't empty.
This does not work properly when:
- The line already contains a marker with a level number.  Vim then doesn't
  know what to <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A>.
- Folds nearby use a level number in their marker which gets in the way.
- The line is inside a comment, <A HREF="options.html#'commentstring'">'commentstring'</A> isn't empty and nested
  comments don't work.  For example with C: adding /* {{{ */ inside a comment
  will truncate the existing comment.  Either put the marker before or after
  the comment, or add the marker manually.
Generally it's not a good idea to let Vim create markers when you already have
markers with a level number.


							*<A NAME="fold-delete-marker"></A><B>fold-delete-marker</B>*
&quot;<A HREF="#zd">zd</A>&quot; can be used to delete a fold defined by markers.  Vim will delete the
markers for you.  Vim will search for the start and end markers, <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> specified
with <A HREF="options.html#'foldmarker'">'foldmarker'</A>, at the start and end of the fold.  When the text around the
marker matches with <A HREF="options.html#'commentstring'">'commentstring'</A>, that text is deleted <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> well.
This does not work properly when:
- A line contains more than one marker and one of them specifies a level.
  Only the first one is removed, without checking if this will have the
  desired effect of <A HREF="change.html#deleting">deleting</A> the fold.
- The marker contains a level number and is used to start or end several <A HREF="#folds">folds</A>
  at the same time.

==============================================================================

2. Fold commands				*<A NAME="fold-commands"></A><B>fold-commands</B>* *<A NAME="E490"></A><B>E490</B>*

All <A HREF="#folding">folding</A> commands start with &quot;<A HREF="vimindex.html#z">z</A>&quot;.  Hint: the &quot;<A HREF="vimindex.html#z">z</A>&quot; looks like a folded piece
of paper, if you look at <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> from the side.


<B><FONT color="#54A23D">CREATING AND DELETING FOLDS </FONT></B>

							*<A NAME="zf"></A><B>zf</B>* *<A NAME="E350"></A><B>E350</B>*
zf{motion}  or
{Visual}zf	Operator to create a fold.
		This only works when <A HREF="options.html#'foldmethod'">'foldmethod'</A> is &quot;manual&quot; or &quot;marker&quot;.
		The new fold will be closed for the &quot;manual&quot; method.
		<A HREF="options.html#'foldenable'">'foldenable'</A> will be set.

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">OPENING AND CLOSING FOLDS </FONT></B>

A fold smaller than <A HREF="options.html#'foldminlines'">'foldminlines'</A> will always be displayed like <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> was open.
Therefore the commands below may work differently on small <A HREF="#folds">folds</A>.


							*<A NAME="zo"></A><B>zo</B>*
<A HREF="#zo">zo</A>		Open one fold under the cursor.  When a <A HREF="intro.html#count">count</A> is given, that

3. Fold <A HREF="options.html#options">options</A>					*<A NAME="fold-options"></A><B>fold-options</B>*


COLORS							*<A NAME="fold-colors"></A><B>fold-colors</B>*

The colors of a closed fold are set with the Folded group |<A HREF="syntax.html#hl-Folded">hl-Folded</A>|.  The
colors of the fold column are set with the FoldColumn group |<A HREF="syntax.html#hl-FoldColumn">hl-FoldColumn</A>|.
Example to set the colors:

<B>	:highlight Folded guibg=grey guifg=blue</B>
<B>	:highlight FoldColumn guibg=darkgrey guifg=white</B>



FOLDLEVEL						*<A NAME="fold-foldlevel"></A><B>fold-foldlevel</B>*

<A HREF="options.html#'foldlevel'">'foldlevel'</A> is a number option: The higher the more folded regions are open.
When <A HREF="options.html#'foldlevel'">'foldlevel'</A> is 0, all <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> are closed.
When <A HREF="options.html#'foldlevel'">'foldlevel'</A> is positive, some <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> are closed.
When <A HREF="options.html#'foldlevel'">'foldlevel'</A> is very high, all <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> are open.
<A HREF="options.html#'foldlevel'">'foldlevel'</A> is applied when <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> is changed.  After that manually <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> can be
opened and closed.
When increased, <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> above the new level are opened.  No manually opened
<A HREF="#folds">folds</A> will be closed.
When decreased, <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> above the new level are closed.  No manually closed
<A HREF="#folds">folds</A> will be opened.



FOLDTEXT						*<A NAME="fold-foldtext"></A><B>fold-foldtext</B>*

<A HREF="options.html#'foldtext'">'foldtext'</A> is a <A HREF="eval.html#string">string</A> option that specifies an <A HREF="eval.html#expression">expression</A>.  This <A HREF="eval.html#expression">expression</A>
is evaluated to obtain the text displayed for a closed fold.  Example:

<B>    :set foldtext=v:folddashes.substitute(getline(v:foldstart),'/\\*\\\|\\*/\\\|{{{\\d\\=','','g')</B>

This shows the first line of the fold, with &quot;/*&quot;, &quot;*/&quot; and &quot;{{{&quot; removed.
Note the use of backslashes to avoid some characters to be interpreted by the
&quot;<A HREF="options.html#:set">:set</A>&quot; command.  It's simpler to define a function and call that:

<B>    :set foldtext=MyFoldText()</B>
<B>    :function MyFoldText()</B>
<B>    :  let line = getline(v:foldstart)</B>
<B>    :  let sub = substitute(line, '/\*\|\*/\|{{{\d\=', '', 'g')</B>
<B>    :  return v:folddashes . sub</B>
<B>    :endfunction</B>

Evaluating <A HREF="options.html#'foldtext'">'foldtext'</A> is done in the |<A HREF="eval.html#sandbox">sandbox</A>|.  The current <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A> is set to
the <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A> that displays the line.  Errors are ignored.

The default value is |<A HREF="eval.html#foldtext()">foldtext()</A>|.  This returns a reasonable text for most
types of <A HREF="#folding">folding</A>.  If you don't like <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>, you can specify your own <A HREF="options.html#'foldtext'">'foldtext'</A>
<A HREF="eval.html#expression">expression</A>.  It can use these special Vim <A HREF="eval.html#variables">variables</A>:
	<A HREF="eval.html#v:foldstart">v:foldstart</A>	line number of first line in the fold
	<A HREF="eval.html#v:foldend">v:foldend</A>	line number of last line in the fold
	<A HREF="eval.html#v:folddashes">v:folddashes</A>	a <A HREF="eval.html#string">string</A> that contains dashes to represent the
			foldlevel.
	<A HREF="eval.html#v:foldlevel">v:foldlevel</A>	the foldlevel of the fold

In the result a TAB is replaced with a space and unprintable characters are
made into printable characters.

The resulting line is truncated to fit in the <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A>, <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> never wraps.
When there is room after the text, <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> is filled with the character specified
by <A HREF="options.html#'fillchars'">'fillchars'</A>.

Note that backslashes need to be used for characters that the &quot;<A HREF="options.html#:set">:set</A>&quot; command
handles differently: Space, backslash and double-quote. |<A HREF="options.html#option-backslash">option-backslash</A>|



FOLDCOLUMN						*<A NAME="fold-foldcolumn"></A><B>fold-foldcolumn</B>*

<A HREF="options.html#'foldcolumn'">'foldcolumn'</A> is a number, which sets the width for a column on the side of the
<A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A> to indicate <A HREF="#folds">folds</A>.  When <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> is zero, there is no foldcolumn.  A normal
value is 4 or 5.  The minimal useful value is 2, although 1 still provides
some information.  The maximum is 12.

An open fold is indicated with a column that has a '<A HREF="motion.html#-">-</A>' at the top and '&#124;'
characters below <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>.  This column stops where the open fold stops.  When <A HREF="#folds">folds</A>
nest, the nested fold is one character right of the fold it's contained in.

A closed fold is indicated with a '<A HREF="motion.html#+">+</A>'.

Where the fold column is too narrow to display all nested <A HREF="#folds">folds</A>, digits are
shown to indicate the nesting level.

The mouse can also be used to open and close <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> by clicking in the
fold column:
- Click on a '<A HREF="motion.html#+">+</A>' to open the closed fold at this row.
- Click on any other non-blank character to close the open fold at this row.

==============================================================================

4. Behavior of <A HREF="#folds">folds</A>					*<A NAME="fold-behavior"></A><B>fold-behavior</B>*

When moving the cursor upwards or downwards and when <A HREF="scroll.html#scrolling">scrolling</A>, the cursor
will move to the first line of a sequence of folded lines.  When the cursor is
already on a folded line, <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> moves to the next unfolded line or the next
closed fold.

While the cursor is on folded lines, the cursor is always displayed in the
first column.  The ruler does show the actual cursor position, but since the
line is folded, <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> cannot be displayed there.

Many <A HREF="intro.html#movement">movement</A> commands handle a sequence of folded lines like an empty line.
For example, the &quot;<A HREF="motion.html#w">w</A>&quot; command stops once in the first column.

When in <A HREF="insert.html#Insert">Insert</A> mode, the cursor line is never folded.  That allows you to see
what you type!

When using an <A HREF="motion.html#operator">operator</A>, a closed fold is included <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> a whole.  Thus &quot;<A HREF="change.html#dl">dl</A>&quot;
deletes the whole closed fold under the cursor.

For <A HREF="intro.html#Ex">Ex</A> commands the range is adjusted to always start at the first line of a
closed fold and end at the last line of a closed fold.  Thus this command:
<B>	:s/foo/bar/g</B>
when used with the cursor on a closed fold, will replace &quot;foo&quot; with &quot;<A HREF="motion.html#bar">bar</A>&quot; in
all lines of the fold.
This does not happen for |<A HREF="#:folddoopen">:folddoopen</A>| and |<A HREF="#:folddoclosed">:folddoclosed</A>|.

When editing a buffer that has been edited before, the last used <A HREF="#folding">folding</A>
settings are used again.  For manual <A HREF="#folding">folding</A> the defined <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> are restored.
For all <A HREF="#folding">folding</A> methods the manually opened and closed <A HREF="#folds">folds</A> are restored.
If this buffer has been edited in this <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A>, the values from back then are
used.  Otherwise the values from the <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A> where the buffer was edited last
are used.
