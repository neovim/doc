Vim is open source software.  Everybody is encouraged to contribute to help
improving Vim.  For sending patches a context <A HREF="diff.html#diff">diff</A> &quot;<A HREF="diff.html#diff">diff</A> -c&quot; is preferred.
 Also see	<A HREF="http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/How_to_make_and_submit_a_patch">http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/How_to_make_and_submit_a_patch</A>.

==============================================================================

1. Design goals						*<A NAME="design-goals"></A><B>design-goals</B>*

Most important things come first (roughly).

Note that quite a few items are contradicting.  This is intentional.  A
balance must be found between them.



VIM IS... VI COMPATIBLE					*<A NAME="design-compatible"></A><B>design-compatible</B>*

First of all, <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> should be possible to use Vim <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> a drop-in replacement for
<A HREF="intro.html#Vi">Vi</A>.  When the user wants to, he can use Vim in compatible mode and hardly
notice any difference with the original <A HREF="intro.html#Vi">Vi</A>.

Exceptions:
- We don't reproduce obvious <A HREF="intro.html#Vi">Vi</A> bugs in Vim.
- There are different versions of <A HREF="intro.html#Vi">Vi</A>.  I am using Version 3.7 (6/7/85) <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> a
  reference.  But support for other versions is also included when possible.
  The <A HREF="intro.html#Vi">Vi</A> part of POSIX is not considered a definitive source.
- Vim adds new commands, you cannot rely on some command to fail because <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>
  didn't exist in <A HREF="intro.html#Vi">Vi</A>.
- Vim will have a lot of features that <A HREF="intro.html#Vi">Vi</A> doesn't have.  Going back from Vim
  to <A HREF="intro.html#Vi">Vi</A> will be a problem, this cannot be avoided.
- Some things are hardly ever used (open mode, sending an e-mail when
  crashing, etc.).  Those will only be included when someone has a good reason
  why <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> should be included and it's not too much work.
- For some items <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> is debatable whether <A HREF="intro.html#Vi">Vi</A> compatibility should be
  maintained.  There will be an option flag for these.



VIM IS... IMPROVED					*<A NAME="design-improved"></A><B>design-improved</B>*

The IMproved bits of Vim should make <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> a better <A HREF="intro.html#Vi">Vi</A>, without becoming a
completely different editor.  Extensions are done with a &quot;<A HREF="intro.html#Vi">Vi</A> spirit&quot;.
- Use the keyboard <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> much <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> feasible.  The mouse requires a third hand,
  which we don't have.  Many terminals don't have a mouse.
- When the mouse is used anyway, avoid the need to switch back to the
  keyboard.  Avoid mixing mouse and keyboard handling.
- Add commands and <A HREF="options.html#options">options</A> in a consistent way.  Otherwise people will have a
  hard time finding and remembering them.  Keep in mind that more commands and
  <A HREF="options.html#options">options</A> will be added later.
- A feature that people <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> not know about is a useless feature.  Don't add
  obscure features, or at least add hints in documentation that they exist.
- Minimize using CTRL and other modifiers, they are more difficult to type.
- There are many first-time and inexperienced Vim users.  Make <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> easy for
  them to start using Vim and learn more over time.
- There is no limit to the features that can be added.  Selecting new features
  is one based on (1) what users ask for, (2) how much effort <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> takes to
  implement and (3) someone actually implementing <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>.



VIM IS... MULTI PLATFORM				*<A NAME="design-multi-platform"></A><B>design-multi-platform</B>*

Vim tries to help <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> many users on <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> many platforms <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> possible.
- Support many kinds of terminals.  The minimal demands are cursor positioning
  and clear-screen.  Commands should only use key strokes that most keyboards
  have.  Support all the keys on the keyboard for <A HREF="map.html#mapping">mapping</A>.
- Support many platforms.  A condition is that there is someone willing to <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A>
  Vim <A HREF="#development">development</A> on that platform, and <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> doesn't mean messing up the code.
- Support many compilers and libraries.  Not everybody is able or allowed to
  <A HREF="usr_90.html#install">install</A> another compiler or <A HREF="gui.html#GUI">GUI</A> library.
- People switch from one platform to another, and from <A HREF="gui.html#GUI">GUI</A> to terminal
  version.  Features should be present in all versions, or at least in <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> many
  <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> possible with a reasonable effort.  Try to avoid that users must switch
  between platforms to accomplish their work efficiently.
- That a feature is not possible on some platforms, or only possible on one
  platform, does not mean <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> cannot be implemented.  [This intentionally
  contradicts the previous item, these two must be balanced.]



VIM IS... WELL DOCUMENTED				*<A NAME="design-documented"></A><B>design-documented</B>*

- A feature that isn't documented is a useless feature.  A patch for a new
  feature must include the documentation.
- Documentation should be comprehensive and understandable.  Using examples is
  recommended.
- Don't make the text unnecessarily long.  Less documentation means that an
  item is easier to find.



VIM IS... HIGH SPEED AND SMALL IN SIZE			*<A NAME="design-speed-size"></A><B>design-speed-size</B>*

Using Vim must not be a big attack on system resources.  Keep <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> small and
fast.
- Computers are becoming faster and bigger each year.  Vim can grow too, but
  no faster than computers are growing.  Keep Vim usable on older systems.
- Many users start Vim from a shell very often.  Startup time must be short.
- Commands must work efficiently.  The time they consume must be <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> small <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A>
  possible.  Useful commands may take longer.
- Don't forget that some people use Vim over a slow connection.  Minimize the
  communication overhead.
- Items that add considerably to the size and are not used by many people
  should be a feature that can be disabled.
- Vim is a component among other components.  Don't turn <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> into a massive
  application, but have <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> work well together with other programs.



VIM IS... MAINTAINABLE					*<A NAME="design-maintain"></A><B>design-maintain</B>*

- The source code should not become a mess.  It should be reliable code.
- Use the same layout in all files to make <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> easy to read |<A HREF="#coding-style">coding-style</A>|.
- Use comments in a useful way!  Quoting the function name and argument names
  is NOT useful.  Do explain what they are for.
- Porting to another platform should be made easy, without having to change
  too much platform-independent code.
- Use the object-oriented spirit: Put data and code together.  Minimize the
  knowledge spread to other parts of the code.



VIM IS... FLEXIBLE					*<A NAME="design-flexible"></A><B>design-flexible</B>*

Vim should make <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> easy for users to work in their preferred styles rather
than coercing its users into particular patterns of work.  This can be for
items with a large impact (e.g., the <A HREF="options.html#'compatible'">'compatible'</A> option) or for details.  The
defaults are carefully chosen such that most users will enjoy using Vim <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>
is.  Commands and <A HREF="options.html#options">options</A> can be used to adjust Vim to the desire of the user
and its environment.



VIM IS... NOT						*<A NAME="design-not"></A><B>design-not</B>*

- Vim is not a shell or an Operating System.  You will not be able to run a
  shell inside Vim or use <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> to <A HREF="intro.html#control">control</A> a debugger.  This should work the
  other way around: Use Vim <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> a component from a shell or in an IDE.
  A satirical way to say this: &quot;Unlike Emacs, Vim does not attempt to include
  everything but the kitchen sink, but some people say that you can clean one
  with <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>.  ;-)&quot;
 To use Vim with gdb see:	<A HREF="http://www.agide.org">http://www.agide.org</A> and	<A HREF="http://clewn.sf.net">http://clewn.sf.net</A>.
- Vim is not a fancy <A HREF="gui.html#GUI">GUI</A> editor that tries to look <A HREF="todo.html#nice">nice</A> at the cost of
  being <A HREF="various.html#less">less</A> consistent over all platforms.  But functional <A HREF="gui.html#GUI">GUI</A> features are
  welcomed.

==============================================================================

2. Coding style						*<A NAME="coding-style"></A><B>coding-style</B>*

These are the rules to use when making changes to the Vim source code.  Please
stick to these rules, to keep the sources readable and maintainable.

This <A HREF="eval.html#list">list</A> is not complete.  Look in the source code for more examples.



MAKING CHANGES						*<A NAME="style-changes"></A><B>style-changes</B>*

The basic steps to make changes to the code:
1. Adjust the documentation.  Doing this first gives you an impression of how
   your changes affect the user.
2. Make the source code changes.
3. Check ../doc/todo.txt if the change affects any listed item.
4. Make a patch with &quot;<A HREF="diff.html#diff">diff</A> -c&quot; against the unmodified code and docs.
5. Make a note about what changed and include <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> with the patch.



USE OF COMMON FUNCTIONS					*<A NAME="style-functions"></A><B>style-functions</B>*

Some <A HREF="eval.html#functions">functions</A> that are common to use, have a special Vim version.  Always
consider using the Vim version, because they were introduced with a reason.

NORMAL NAME	VIM NAME	DIFFERENCE OF VIM VERSION
free()		vim_free()	Checks for freeing NULL
malloc()	alloc()		Checks for out of memory situation
malloc()	lalloc()	Like alloc(), but has long argument
strcpy()	STRCPY()	Includes cast to (char *), for char_u &#42; args
<A HREF="eval.html#strchr()">strchr()</A>	vim_strchr()	Accepts special characters
<A HREF="eval.html#strrchr()">strrchr()</A>	vim_strrchr()	Accepts special characters
isspace()	vim_isspace()	Can handle characters <A HREF="change.html#&gt;">&gt;</A> 128
iswhite()	vim_iswhite()	Only TRUE for <A HREF="intro.html#tab">tab</A> and space
memcpy()	mch_memmove()	Handles overlapped copies
bcopy()		mch_memmove()	Handles overlapped copies
memset()	vim_memset()	Uniform for all systems



NAMES							*<A NAME="style-names"></A><B>style-names</B>*

Function names can not be more than 31 characters long (because of VMS).

Don't use &quot;delete&quot; <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> a variable name, C++ doesn't like <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>.

Because of the requirement that Vim runs on <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> many systems <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> possible, we
need to avoid using names that are already defined by the system.  This is a
<A HREF="eval.html#list">list</A> of names that are known to cause trouble.  The name is given <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> a <A HREF="pattern.html#regexp">regexp</A>
<A HREF="pattern.html#pattern">pattern</A>.

is.*()		POSIX, ctype.h
to.*()		POSIX, ctype.h

MAX.*		POSIX, limits.h
__.*		POSIX, system
_[A-Z].*	POSIX, system
E[A-Z0-9]*	POSIX, errno.h

.*_t		POSIX, for typedefs.  Use .*_T instead.

wait		don't use <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> argument to a function, conflicts with types.h
index		shadows global declaration
time		shadows global declaration
new		C++ reserved keyword
try		Borland C++ doesn't like <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> to be used <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> a variable.

clear		<A HREF="os_mac.html#Mac">Mac</A> curses.h

basename()	GNU <A HREF="eval.html#string">string</A> function
dirname()	GNU <A HREF="eval.html#string">string</A> function
get_env_value()	Linux system function



VARIOUS							*<A NAME="style-various"></A><B>style-various</B>*

Typedef'ed names should end in &quot;_T&quot;:
<B>    typedef int some_T;</B>
Define'ed names should be <A HREF="change.html#uppercase">uppercase</A>:
<B>    #define SOME_THING</B>
Features always start with &quot;FEAT_&quot;:
<B>    #define FEAT_FOO</B>

Don't use '\&quot;', some compilers can't handle <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>.  &#39;&#34;'' works fine.

Don't use:
    #if HAVE_SOME
Some compilers can't handle that and complain that &quot;HAVE_SOME&quot; is not defined.
Use
    #ifdef HAVE_SOME
or
    #if defined(HAVE_SOME)



STYLE							*<A NAME="style-examples"></A><B>style-examples</B>*

General rule: One statement per line.

Wrong:	    if (cond) a = 1;

OK:	    if (cond)
		a = 1;

Wrong:	    while (cond);

OK:	    while (cond)
		;

Wrong:	    <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> a = 1; while (cond);

OK:	    <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A>
		a = 1;
	    while (cond);


Functions start with:

Wrong:	int function_name(int arg1, int arg2)

OK:	/*
	 &#42; Explanation of what this function is used for.
	 *
	 &#42; Return value explanation.
	 */
	    int
	function_name(arg1, arg2)
	    int		arg1;		/* short comment about arg1 */
	    int		arg2;		/* short comment about arg2 */
	{
	    int		local;		/* comment about local */

	    local = arg1 &#42; arg2;

NOTE: Don't use ANSI style function declarations.  A few people still have to
use a compiler that doesn't support <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>.



SPACES AND PUNCTUATION					*<A NAME="style-spaces"></A><B>style-spaces</B>*

No space between a function name and the bracket:

Wrong:  func (arg);
OK:	func(arg);

Do use a space after if, while, switch, etc.

Wrong:	if(arg)		for(;;)
OK:	if (arg)	for (;;)

Use a space after a comma and semicolon:

Wrong:  func(arg1,arg2);	for (i = 0;i <A HREF="change.html#&lt;">&lt;</A> 2;++i)
OK:	func(arg1, arg2);	for (i = 0; <A HREF="insert.html#i">i</A> <A HREF="change.html#&lt;">&lt;</A> 2; ++i)

Use a space before and after '<A HREF="change.html#=">=</A>', '<A HREF="motion.html#+">+</A>', '<A HREF="pattern.html#/">/</A>', etc.

Wrong:	var=a*5;
OK:	var = a &#42; 5;

In general: Use empty lines to group lines of code together.  Put a comment
just above the group of lines.  This makes <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> easier to quickly see what is
being done.

OK:	/* Prepare for building the table. */
	get_first_item();
	table_idx = 0;

	/* Build the table */
	while (has_item())
	    table[table_idx++] = next_item();

	/* Finish up. */
	cleanup_items();
	generate_hash(table);

==============================================================================

3. Design decisions					*<A NAME="design-decisions"></A><B>design-decisions</B>*

<A HREF="fold.html#Folding">Folding</A>

Several forms of <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A> should be possible for the same buffer.  For example,
have one <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A> that shows the text with function bodies folded, another
<A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A> that shows a function body.

<A HREF="fold.html#Folding">Folding</A> is a way to display the text.  It should not change the text itself.
Therefore the <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A> has been implemented <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> a <A HREF="change.html#filter">filter</A> between the text stored
in a buffer (buffer lines) and the text displayed in a <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A> (logical lines).


Naming the <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A>

The <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A> &quot;<A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A>&quot; is commonly used for several things: A <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A> on the screen,
the xterm <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A>, a <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A> inside Vim to <A HREF="starting.html#view">view</A> a buffer.
To avoid confusion, other items that are sometimes called <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A> have been
given another name.  Here is an overview of the related items:

screen		The whole display.  For the <A HREF="gui.html#GUI">GUI</A> it's something like 1024x768
		pixels.  The Vim shell can use the whole screen or part of <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>.
shell		The Vim application.  This can cover the whole screen (e.g.,
		when running in a console) or part of <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> (xterm or <A HREF="gui.html#GUI">GUI</A>).
<A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A>		<A HREF="starting.html#View">View</A> on a buffer.  There can be several <A HREF="windows.html#windows">windows</A> in Vim,
		together with the command line, menubar, toolbar, etc. they
		fit in the shell.



Spell checking						*<A NAME="develop-spell"></A><B>develop-spell</B>*

When <A HREF="spell.html#spell">spell</A> checking was going to be added to Vim a survey was done over the
available <A HREF="spell.html#spell">spell</A> checking libraries and programs.  Unfortunately, the result
was that none of them provided sufficient capabilities to be used <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> the <A HREF="spell.html#spell">spell</A>
checking engine in Vim, for various reasons:

- Missing support for <A HREF="mbyte.html#multi-byte">multi-byte</A> encodings.  At least <A HREF="mbyte.html#UTF-8">UTF-8</A> must be supported,
  so that more than one language can be used in the same file.
  Doing on-the-fly conversion is not always possible (would require iconv
  support).
- For the programs and libraries: Using them as-is would require installing
  them separately from Vim.  That's mostly not impossible, but a drawback.
- Performance: A few tests showed that it's possible to check spelling on the
  fly (while redrawing), just like <A HREF="syntax.html#syntax">syntax</A> highlighting.  But the mechanisms
  used by other code are much slower.  <A HREF="spell.html#Myspell">Myspell</A> uses a hashtable, for example.
  The affix compression that most <A HREF="spell.html#spell">spell</A> checkers use makes <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> slower too.
- For using an external program like aspell a communication mechanism would
  have to be setup.  That's complicated to <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> in a portable way (Unix-only
  would be relatively simple, but that's not good enough).  And performance
  will become a problem (lots of process switching involved).
- Missing support for words with non-word characters, such <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> &quot;Etten-Leur&quot; and
  &quot;et al.&quot;, would require marking the pieces of them OK, lowering the
  reliability.
- Missing support for regions or dialects.  Makes <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> difficult to accept
  all English words and highlight non-Canadian words differently.
- Missing support for rare words.  Many words are correct but hardly ever used
  and could be a misspelled often-used <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A>.
- For making suggestions the speed is <A HREF="various.html#less">less</A> important and requiring to <A HREF="usr_90.html#install">install</A>
  another program or library would be acceptable.  But the <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A> lists probably
  differ, the suggestions may be wrong words.



Spelling suggestions				*<A NAME="develop-spell-suggestions"></A><B>develop-spell-suggestions</B>*

For making suggestions there are two basic mechanisms:
1. Try <A HREF="change.html#changing">changing</A> the bad <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A> a little bit and check for a match with a good
   <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A>.  Or go through the <A HREF="eval.html#list">list</A> of good words, change them a little bit and
   check for a match with the bad <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A>.  The changes are <A HREF="change.html#deleting">deleting</A> a character,
   <A HREF="insert.html#inserting">inserting</A> a character, swapping two characters, etc.
2. Perform soundfolding on both the bad <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A> and the good words and then find
   matches, possibly with a few changes like with the first mechanism.

The first is good for finding typing mistakes.  After experimenting with
hashtables and looking at solutions from other <A HREF="spell.html#spell">spell</A> checkers the conclusion
was that a trie (a kind of tree structure) is ideal for this.  Both for
reducing memory use and being able to try sensible changes.  For example, when
<A HREF="insert.html#inserting">inserting</A> a character only characters that lead to good words need to be
tried.  Other mechanisms (with hashtables) need to try all possible letters at
every position in the <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A>.  Also, a hashtable has the requirement that <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A>
boundaries are identified separately, while a trie does not require this.
That makes the mechanism a lot simpler.

Soundfolding is useful when someone knows how the words sounds but doesn't
know how <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> is spelled.  For example, the <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A> &quot;dictionary&quot; might be written
<A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> &quot;daktonerie&quot;.  The number of changes that the first method would need to
try is very big, it's hard to find the good <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A> that way.  After soundfolding
the words become &quot;tktnr&quot; and &quot;tkxnry&quot;, these differ by only two letters.

To find words by their soundfolded equivalent (soundalike <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A>) we need a <A HREF="eval.html#list">list</A>
of all soundfolded words.  A few experiments have been done to find out what
the best method is.  Alternatives:
1. Do the sound <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A> on the fly when looking for suggestions.  This means
   walking through the trie of good words, soundfolding each <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A> and
   checking how different <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> is from the bad <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A>.  This is very efficient for
   memory use, but takes a long time.  On a fast PC <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> takes a couple of
   seconds for English, which can be acceptable for interactive use.  But for
   some languages <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> takes more than ten seconds (e.g., German, Catalan),
   which is unacceptable slow.  For batch processing (automatic corrections)
   it's too slow for all languages.
2. Use a trie for the soundfolded words, so that searching can be done just
   like how <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> works without soundfolding.  This requires remembering a <A HREF="eval.html#list">list</A>
   of good words for each soundfolded <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A>.  This makes finding matches very
   fast but requires quite a lot of memory, in the order of 1 to 10 Mbyte.
   For some languages more than the original <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A> <A HREF="eval.html#list">list</A>.
3. Like the second alternative, but reduce the amount of memory by using affix
   compression and store only the soundfolded basic <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A>.  This is what Aspell
   does.  Disadvantage is that affixes need to be stripped from the bad <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A>
   before soundfolding <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>, which means that mistakes at the start and/or end
   of the <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A> will cause the mechanism to fail.  Also, this becomes slow when
   the bad <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A> is quite different from the good <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A>.

The choice made is to use the second mechanism and use a separate file.  This
way a user with sufficient memory can get very good suggestions while a user
who is short of memory or just wants the <A HREF="spell.html#spell">spell</A> checking and no suggestions
doesn't use so much memory.


Word frequency

For <A HREF="change.html#sorting">sorting</A> suggestions <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> helps to know which words are common.  In theory we
could store a <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A> frequency with the <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A> in the dictionary.  However, this
requires storing a <A HREF="intro.html#count">count</A> per <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A>.  That degrades <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A> tree compression a lot.
And maintaining the <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A> frequency for all languages will be a heavy task.
Also, <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> would be <A HREF="todo.html#nice">nice</A> to prefer words that are already in the text.  This way
the words that appear in the specific text are preferred for suggestions.

What has been implemented is to <A HREF="intro.html#count">count</A> words that have been seen during
displaying.  A hashtable is used to quickly find the <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A> <A HREF="intro.html#count">count</A>.  The <A HREF="intro.html#count">count</A> is
initialized from words listed in COMMON items in the affix file, so that <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>
also works when starting a new file.

This isn't ideal, because the longer Vim is running the higher the counts
become.  But in practice <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> is a noticeable improvement over not using the <A HREF="motion.html#word">word</A>
<A HREF="intro.html#count">count</A>.
