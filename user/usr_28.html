Structured text can be separated in sections.  And sections in sub-sections.
<A HREF="fold.html#Folding">Folding</A> allows you to display a section <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> one line, providing an overview.
This chapter explains the different ways this can be done.

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="28.1"></A><B>28.1</B>*	What is <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A>?

<A HREF="fold.html#Folding">Folding</A> is used to show a range of lines in the buffer <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> a single line on the
screen.  Like a piece of paper which is folded to make <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> shorter:

	+------------------------+
	&#124; line 1		 |
	&#124; line 2		 |
	&#124; line 3		 |
	|_______________________ |
	\			 \
	 \________________________\
	 / folded lines		  /
	/________________________/
	&#124; line 12		 |
	&#124; line 13		 |
	&#124; line 14		 |
	+------------------------+

The text is still in the buffer, unchanged.  Only the way lines are displayed
is affected by <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A>.

The advantage of <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A> is that you can get a better overview of the
structure of text, by <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A> lines of a section and <A HREF="change.html#replacing">replacing</A> <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> with a line
that indicates that there is a section.

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="28.2"></A><B>28.2</B>*	Manual <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A>

Try <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> out: Position the cursor in a <A HREF="motion.html#paragraph">paragraph</A> and type:

<B>	zfap</B>

You will see that the <A HREF="motion.html#paragraph">paragraph</A> is replaced by a highlighted line.  You have
created a fold.  |<A HREF="fold.html#zf">zf</A>| is an <A HREF="motion.html#operator">operator</A> and |<A HREF="motion.html#ap">ap</A>| a text object selection.  You
can use the |<A HREF="fold.html#zf">zf</A>| <A HREF="motion.html#operator">operator</A> with any <A HREF="intro.html#movement">movement</A> command to create a fold for the
text that <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> moved over.  |<A HREF="fold.html#zf">zf</A>| also works in <A HREF="visual.html#Visual">Visual</A> mode.

To view the text again, open the fold by typing:

<B>	zo</B>

And you can close the fold again with:

<B>	zc</B>

All the <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A> commands start with &quot;<A HREF="vimindex.html#z">z</A>&quot;.  With some fantasy, this looks like a
folded piece of paper, seen from the side.  The <A HREF="print.html#letter">letter</A> after the &quot;<A HREF="vimindex.html#z">z</A>&quot; has a
mnemonic meaning to make <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> easier to remember the commands:

	<A HREF="fold.html#zf">zf</A>	F-old creation
	<A HREF="fold.html#zo">zo</A>	O-pen a fold
	<A HREF="fold.html#zc">zc</A>	C-lose a fold

Folds can be nested: A region of text that contains <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> can be folded
again.  For example, you can fold each <A HREF="motion.html#paragraph">paragraph</A> in this section, and then
fold all the sections in this chapter.  Try <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> out.  You will notice that
opening the fold for the whole chapter will restore the nested <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> they
were, some may be open and some may be closed.

Suppose you have created several <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A>, and now want to view all the text.
You could go to each fold and type &quot;<A HREF="fold.html#zo">zo</A>&quot;.  To <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> this faster, use this command:

<B>	zr</B>

This will R-educe the <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A>.  The opposite is:

<B>	zm</B>

This <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> M-ore.  You can repeat &quot;<A HREF="fold.html#zr">zr</A>&quot; and &quot;<A HREF="fold.html#zm">zm</A>&quot; to open and close nested <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A>
of several levels.

If you have nested several levels deep, you can open all of them with:

<B>	zR</B>

This R-educes <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> until there are none left.  And you can close all <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A>
with:

<B>	zM</B>

This <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> M-ore and M-ore.

You can quickly disable the <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A> with the |<A HREF="fold.html#zn">zn</A>| command.  Then |<A HREF="fold.html#zN">zN</A>| brings
back the <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A> <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> was.  |<A HREF="fold.html#zi">zi</A>| toggles between the two.  This is a useful
way of working:
- create <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> to get overview on your file
- move around to where you want to <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> your work
- <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> |<A HREF="fold.html#zi">zi</A>| to look at the text and edit <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>
- <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> |<A HREF="fold.html#zi">zi</A>| again to go back to moving around

More about manual <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A> in the reference manual: |<A HREF="fold.html#fold-manual">fold-manual</A>|

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="28.3"></A><B>28.3</B>*	Working with <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A>

When some <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> are closed, <A HREF="intro.html#movement">movement</A> commands like &quot;<A HREF="motion.html#j">j</A>&quot; and &quot;<A HREF="motion.html#k">k</A>&quot; move over a
fold like <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> was a single, empty line.  This allows you to quickly move around
over folded text.

You can <A HREF="change.html#yank">yank</A>, delete and put <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> if <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> was a single line.  This is very
useful if you want to reorder <A HREF="eval.html#functions">functions</A> in a program.  First make sure that
each fold contains a whole function (or a bit <A HREF="various.html#less">less</A>) by selecting the right
<A HREF="options.html#'foldmethod'">'foldmethod'</A>.  Then delete the function with &quot;<A HREF="change.html#dd">dd</A>&quot;, move the cursor and put <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>
with &quot;<A HREF="change.html#p">p</A>&quot;.  If some lines of the function are above or below the fold, you can
use <A HREF="visual.html#Visual">Visual</A> selection:
- put the cursor on the first line to be moved
- hit &quot;<A HREF="visual.html#V">V</A>&quot; to start <A HREF="visual.html#Visual">Visual</A> mode
- put the cursor on the last line to be moved
- hit &quot;<A HREF="change.html#d">d</A>&quot; to delete the selected lines.
- move the cursor to the new position and &quot;p&quot;ut the lines there.

It is sometimes difficult to see or remember where a fold is located, thus
where a |<A HREF="fold.html#zo">zo</A>| command would actually work.  To see the defined <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A>:

<B>	:set foldcolumn=4</B>

This will show a small column on the left of the <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A> to indicate <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A>.
A &quot;<A HREF="motion.html#+">+</A>&quot; is shown for a closed fold.  A &quot;<A HREF="motion.html#-">-</A>&quot; is shown at the start of each open
fold and &quot;|&quot; at following lines of the fold.

You can use the mouse to open a fold by clicking on the &quot;<A HREF="motion.html#+">+</A>&quot; in the foldcolumn.
Clicking on the &quot;<A HREF="motion.html#-">-</A>&quot; or a &quot;|&quot; below <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> will close an open fold.

To open all <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> at the cursor line use |<A HREF="fold.html#zO">zO</A>|.
To close all <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> at the cursor line use |<A HREF="fold.html#zC">zC</A>|.
To delete a fold at the cursor line use |<A HREF="fold.html#zd">zd</A>|.
To delete all <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> at the cursor line use |<A HREF="fold.html#zD">zD</A>|.

When in <A HREF="insert.html#Insert">Insert</A> mode, the fold at the cursor line is never closed.  That allows
you to see what you type!

Folds are opened automatically when jumping around or moving the cursor left
or right.  For example, the &quot;<A HREF="motion.html#0">0</A>&quot; command opens the fold under the cursor
(if <A HREF="options.html#'foldopen'">'foldopen'</A> contains &quot;hor&quot;, which is the default).  The <A HREF="options.html#'foldopen'">'foldopen'</A> option
can be changed to open <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> for specific commands.  If you want the line
under the cursor always to be open, <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> this:

<B>	:set foldopen=all</B>

Warning: You won't be able to move onto a closed fold then.  You might want to
use this only temporarily and then set <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> back to the default:

<B>	:set foldopen&amp;</B>

You can make <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> close automatically when you move out of <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>:

<B>	:set foldclose=all</B>

This will re-apply <A HREF="options.html#'foldlevel'">'foldlevel'</A> to all <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> that don't contain the cursor.
You have to try <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> out if you like how this feels.  Use |<A HREF="fold.html#zm">zm</A>| to fold more and
|<A HREF="fold.html#zr">zr</A>| to fold <A HREF="various.html#less">less</A> (reduce <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A>).

The <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A> is local to the <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A>.  This allows you to open two <A HREF="windows.html#windows">windows</A> on
the same buffer, one with <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> and one without <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A>.  Or one with all <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A>
closed and one with all <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> open.

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="28.4"></A><B>28.4</B>*	Saving and restoring <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A>

When you <A HREF="editing.html#abandon">abandon</A> a file (starting to edit another one), the state of the <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A>
is lost.  If you come back to the same file later, all manually opened and
closed <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> are back to their default.  When <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> have been created
manually, all <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> are gone!  To save the <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> use the |<A HREF="starting.html#:mkview">:mkview</A>| command:

<B>	:mkview</B>

This will store the settings and other things that influence the view on the
file.  You can change what is stored with the <A HREF="options.html#'viewoptions'">'viewoptions'</A> option.
When you come back to the same file later, you can load the view again:

<B>	:loadview</B>

You can store up to ten views on one file.  For example, to save the current
setup <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> the third view and load the second view:

<B>	:mkview 3</B>
<B>	:loadview 2</B>

Note that when you insert or delete lines the views might become invalid.
Also check out the <A HREF="options.html#'viewdir'">'viewdir'</A> option, which specifies where the views are
stored.  You might want to delete old views now and then.

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="28.5"></A><B>28.5</B>*	<A HREF="fold.html#Folding">Folding</A> by indent

Defining <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> with |<A HREF="fold.html#zf">zf</A>| is a lot of work.  If your text is structured by
giving lower level items a larger indent, you can use the indent <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A>
method.  This will create <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> for every sequence of lines with the same
indent.  Lines with a larger indent will become nested <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A>.  This works well
with many programming languages.

Try this by setting the <A HREF="options.html#'foldmethod'">'foldmethod'</A> option:

<B>	:set foldmethod=indent</B>

Then you can use the |<A HREF="fold.html#zm">zm</A>| and |<A HREF="fold.html#zr">zr</A>| commands to fold more and reduce <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A>.
It's easy to see on this example text:

This line is not indented
	This line is indented once
		This line is indented <A HREF="if_cscop.html#twice">twice</A>
		This line is indented <A HREF="if_cscop.html#twice">twice</A>
	This line is indented once
This line is not indented
	This line is indented once
	This line is indented once

Note that the relation between the amount of indent and the fold depth depends
on the <A HREF="options.html#'shiftwidth'">'shiftwidth'</A> option.  Each <A HREF="options.html#'shiftwidth'">'shiftwidth'</A> worth of indent adds one to the
depth of the fold.  This is called a fold level.

When you use the |<A HREF="fold.html#zr">zr</A>| and |<A HREF="fold.html#zm">zm</A>| commands you actually increase or decrease the
<A HREF="options.html#'foldlevel'">'foldlevel'</A> option.  You could also set <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> directly:

<B>	:set foldlevel=3</B>

This means that all <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> with three times a <A HREF="options.html#'shiftwidth'">'shiftwidth'</A> indent or more will
be closed.  The lower the foldlevel, the more <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> will be closed.  When
<A HREF="options.html#'foldlevel'">'foldlevel'</A> is zero, all <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> are closed.  |<A HREF="fold.html#zM">zM</A>| does set <A HREF="options.html#'foldlevel'">'foldlevel'</A> to zero.
The opposite command |<A HREF="fold.html#zR">zR</A>| sets <A HREF="options.html#'foldlevel'">'foldlevel'</A> to the deepest fold level that is
present in the file.

Thus there are two ways to open and close the <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A>:
(A) By setting the fold level.
    This gives a very quick way of &quot;zooming out&quot; to view the structure of the
    text, move the cursor, and &quot;zoom in&quot; on the text again.

(B) By using |<A HREF="fold.html#zo">zo</A>| and |<A HREF="fold.html#zc">zc</A>| commands to open or close specific <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A>.
    This allows opening only those <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> that you want to be open, while other
    <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> remain closed.

This can be combined: You can first close most <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> by using |<A HREF="fold.html#zm">zm</A>| a few times
and then open a specific fold with |<A HREF="fold.html#zo">zo</A>|.  Or open all <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> with |<A HREF="fold.html#zR">zR</A>| and
then close specific <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> with |<A HREF="fold.html#zc">zc</A>|.

But you cannot manually define <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> when <A HREF="options.html#'foldmethod'">'foldmethod'</A> is &quot;indent&quot;, <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> that
would conflict with the relation between the indent and the fold level.

More about <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A> by indent in the reference manual: |<A HREF="fold.html#fold-indent">fold-indent</A>|

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="28.6"></A><B>28.6</B>*	<A HREF="fold.html#Folding">Folding</A> with markers

Markers in the text are used to specify the start and end of a fold region.
This gives precise <A HREF="intro.html#control">control</A> over which lines are included in a fold.  The
disadvantage is that the text needs to be modified.

Try <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>:

<B>	:set foldmethod=marker</B>

Example text, <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> could appear in a C program:

	/* foobar () {{{ */
	int foobar()
	{
		/* return a value {{{ */
		return <A HREF="usr_42.html#42">42</A>;
		/* }}} */
	}
	/* }}} */

Notice that the folded line will display the text before the marker.  This is
very useful to tell what the fold contains.

It's quite annoying when the markers don't pair up correctly after moving some
lines around.  This can be avoided by using numbered markers.  Example:

	/* global <A HREF="eval.html#variables">variables</A> {{{1 */
	int varA, varB;

	/* <A HREF="eval.html#functions">functions</A> {{{1 */
	/* funcA() {{{2 */
	void funcA() <A HREF="intro.html#{}">{}</A>

	/* funcB() {{{2 */
	void funcB() <A HREF="intro.html#{}">{}</A>
	/* }}}1 */

At every numbered marker a fold at the specified level begins.  This will make
any fold at a higher level stop here.  You can just use numbered start markers
to define all <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A>.  Only when you want to explicitly stop a fold before
another starts you need to add an end marker.

More about <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A> with markers in the reference manual: |<A HREF="fold.html#fold-marker">fold-marker</A>|

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="28.7"></A><B>28.7</B>*	<A HREF="fold.html#Folding">Folding</A> by <A HREF="syntax.html#syntax">syntax</A>

For each language Vim uses a different <A HREF="syntax.html#syntax">syntax</A> file.  This defines the colors
for various items in the file.  If you are reading this in Vim, in a terminal
that supports colors, the colors you see are made with the &quot;help&quot; <A HREF="syntax.html#syntax">syntax</A> file.
   In the <A HREF="syntax.html#syntax">syntax</A> files <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> is possible to add <A HREF="syntax.html#syntax">syntax</A> items that have the &quot;fold&quot;
argument.  These define a fold region.  This requires <A HREF="editing.html#writing">writing</A> a <A HREF="syntax.html#syntax">syntax</A> file
and adding these items in <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>.  That's not so easy to <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A>.  But once it's done,
all <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A> happens automatically.
   Here we'll assume you are using an existing <A HREF="syntax.html#syntax">syntax</A> file.  Then there is
nothing more to explain.  You can open and close <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> explained above.
The <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> will be created and deleted automatically when you edit the file.

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="28.8"></A><B>28.8</B>*	<A HREF="fold.html#Folding">Folding</A> by <A HREF="eval.html#expression">expression</A>

This is similar to <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A> by indent, but instead of using the indent of a
line a user function is called to compute the fold level of a line.  You can
use this for text where something in the text indicates which lines belong
together.  An example is an e-mail message where the quoted text is indicated
by a &quot;<A HREF="change.html#&gt;">&gt;</A>&quot; before the line.  To fold these <A HREF="quotes.html#quotes">quotes</A> use this:

<B>	:set foldmethod=expr</B>
<B>	:set foldexpr=strlen(substitute(substitute(getline(v:lnum),'\\s','',\"g\"),'[^&gt;].*','',''))</B>

You can try <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> out on this text:

<A HREF="change.html#&gt;">&gt;</A> quoted text he wrote
<A HREF="change.html#&gt;">&gt;</A> quoted text he wrote
<A HREF="change.html#&gt;">&gt;</A> <A HREF="change.html#&gt;">&gt;</A> double quoted text I wrote
<A HREF="change.html#&gt;">&gt;</A> <A HREF="change.html#&gt;">&gt;</A> double quoted text I wrote

Explanation for the <A HREF="options.html#'foldexpr'">'foldexpr'</A> used in the example (inside out):
   getline(v:lnum)			gets the current line
   substitute(...,'\\s','','g')		removes all white space from the line
   substitute(...,'[^&gt;].*','','')	removes everything after leading '&gt;'s
   strlen(...)				counts the length of the <A HREF="eval.html#string">string</A>, which
					is the number of '&gt;'s found

Note that a <A HREF="intro.html#backslash">backslash</A> must be inserted before every space, double <A HREF="change.html#quote">quote</A> and
<A HREF="intro.html#backslash">backslash</A> for the &quot;<A HREF="options.html#:set">:set</A>&quot; command.  If this confuses you, <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A>

<B>	:set foldexpr</B>

to check the actual resulting value.  To correct a complicated <A HREF="eval.html#expression">expression</A>, use
the command-line completion:

<B>	:set foldexpr=&lt;Tab&gt;</B>

Where <A HREF="motion.html#&lt;Tab&gt;">&lt;Tab&gt;</A> is a real <A HREF="intro.html#Tab">Tab</A>.  Vim will fill in the previous value, which you can
then edit.

When the <A HREF="eval.html#expression">expression</A> gets more complicated you should put <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> in a function and
set <A HREF="options.html#'foldexpr'">'foldexpr'</A> to call that function.

More about <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A> by <A HREF="eval.html#expression">expression</A> in the reference manual: |<A HREF="fold.html#fold-expr">fold-expr</A>|

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="28.9"></A><B>28.9</B>*	<A HREF="fold.html#Folding">Folding</A> unchanged lines

This is useful when you set the <A HREF="options.html#'diff'">'diff'</A> option in the same <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A>.  The
|<A HREF="starting.html#-d">-d</A>| option does this for you.  Example:

<B>	:setlocal diff foldmethod=diff scrollbind nowrap foldlevel=1</B>

Do this in every <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A> that shows a different version of the same file.  You
will clearly see the differences between the files, while the text that didn't
change is folded.

For more details see |<A HREF="fold.html#fold-diff">fold-diff</A>|.

*<A NAME="28.10"></A><B>28.10</B>* Which fold method to use?

All these possibilities make you wonder which method you should choose.
Unfortunately, there is no golden rule.  Here are some hints.

If there is a <A HREF="syntax.html#syntax">syntax</A> file with <A HREF="fold.html#folding">folding</A> for the language you are editing, that
is probably the best choice.  If there isn't one, you might try to write <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>.
This requires a good knowledge of search patterns.  It's not easy, but when
it's working you will not have to define <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> manually.

Typing commands to manually fold regions can be used for unstructured text.
Then use the |<A HREF="starting.html#:mkview">:mkview</A>| command to save and restore your <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A>.

The marker method requires you to change the file.  If you are sharing the
files with other people or you have to meet company standards, you might not
be allowed to add them.
   The main advantage of markers is that you can put them exactly where you
want them.  That avoids that a few lines are missed when you cut and paste
<A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A>.  And you can add a comment about what is contained in the fold.

<A HREF="fold.html#Folding">Folding</A> by indent is something that works in many files, but not always very
well.  Use <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> when you can't use one of the other methods.  However, <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> is
very useful for outlining.  Then you specifically use one <A HREF="options.html#'shiftwidth'">'shiftwidth'</A> for
each nesting level.

<A HREF="fold.html#Folding">Folding</A> with expressions can make <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> in almost any structured text.  It is
quite simple to specify, especially if the start and end of a fold can easily
be recognized.
   If you use the &quot;<A HREF="eval.html#expr">expr</A>&quot; method to define <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A>, but they are not exactly how
you want them, you could switch to the &quot;manual&quot; method.  This will not remove
the defined <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A>.  Then you can delete or add <A HREF="fold.html#folds">folds</A> manually.
