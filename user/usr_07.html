			  Editing more than one file


No matter how many files you have, you can edit them without leaving Vim.
Define a <A HREF="eval.html#list">list</A> of files to work on and jump from one to the other.  Copy text
from one file and put <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> in another one.

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="07.1"></A><B>07.1</B>*	Edit another file

So far you had to start Vim for every file you wanted to edit.  There is a
simpler way.  To start editing another file, use this command:

<B>	:edit foo.txt</B>

You can use any file name instead of &quot;foo.txt&quot;.  Vim will close the current
file and open the new one.  If the current file has unsaved changes, however,
Vim displays an error message and does not open the new file:

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	E37: No write since last change (use ! to override) </FONT></B>

	Note:
	Vim puts an error ID at the start of each error message.  If you <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A>
	not understand the message or what caused <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>, look in the help system
	for this ID.  In this <A HREF="change.html#case">case</A>:

<B>		:help E37</B>

At this point, you have a number of alternatives.  You can write the file
using this command:

<B>	:write</B>

Or you can force Vim to <A HREF="editing.html#discard">discard</A> your changes and edit the new file, using the
force (!) character:

<B>	:edit! foo.txt</B>

If you want to edit another file, but not write the changes in the current
file yet, you can make <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> hidden:

<B>	:hide edit foo.txt</B>

The text with changes is still there, but you can't see <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>.  This is further
explained in section |22.4|: The buffer <A HREF="eval.html#list">list</A>.

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="07.2"></A><B>07.2</B>*	A <A HREF="eval.html#list">list</A> of files

You can start Vim to edit a sequence of files.  For example:

<B>	vim one.c two.c three.c</B>

This command starts Vim and tells <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> that you will be editing three files.
Vim displays just the first file.  After you have done your thing in this
file, to edit the next file you use this command:

<B>	:next</B>

If you have unsaved changes in the current file, you will get an error
message and the &quot;<A HREF="editing.html#:next">:next</A>&quot; will not work.  This is the same problem <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> with
&quot;<A HREF="editing.html#:edit">:edit</A>&quot; mentioned in the previous section.  To <A HREF="editing.html#abandon">abandon</A> the changes:

<B>	:next!</B>

But mostly you want to save the changes and move on to the next file.  There
is a special command for this:

<B>	:wnext</B>

This does the same <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> using two separate commands:

<B>	:write</B>
<B>	:next</B>


WHERE AM I?

To see which file in the argument <A HREF="eval.html#list">list</A> you are editing, look in the <A HREF="windows.html#window">window</A>
title.  It should show something like &quot;(2 of 3)&quot;.  This means you are editing
the second file out of three files.
   If you want to see the <A HREF="eval.html#list">list</A> of files, use this command:

<B>	:args</B>

This is short for &quot;arguments&quot;.  The output might look like this:

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	one.c [two.c] three.c </FONT></B>

These are the files you started Vim with.  The one you are currently editing,
&quot;two.c&quot;, is in square brackets.


MOVING TO OTHER ARGUMENTS

To go back one file:

<B>	:previous</B>

This is just like the &quot;<A HREF="editing.html#:next">:next</A>&quot; command, except that <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> moves in the other
direction.  Again, there is a shortcut command for when you want to write the
file first:

<B>	:wprevious</B>

To move to the very last file in the <A HREF="eval.html#list">list</A>:

<B>	:last</B>

And to move back to the first one again:

<B>	:first</B>

There is no &quot;:wlast&quot; or &quot;:wfirst&quot; command though!

You can use a <A HREF="intro.html#count">count</A> for &quot;<A HREF="editing.html#:next">:next</A>&quot; and &quot;<A HREF="editing.html#:previous">:previous</A>&quot;.  To skip two files forward:

<B>	:2next</B>


AUTOMATIC WRITING

When moving around the files and making changes, you have to remember to use
&quot;<A HREF="editing.html#:write">:write</A>&quot;.  Otherwise you will get an error message.  If you are sure you
always want to write modified files, you can tell Vim to automatically write
them:

<B>	:set autowrite</B>

When you are editing a file which you may not want to write, switch <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> off
again:

<B>	:set noautowrite</B>


EDITING ANOTHER LIST OF FILES

You can redefine the <A HREF="eval.html#list">list</A> of files without the need to exit Vim and start <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>
again.  Use this command to edit three other files:

<B>	:args five.c six.c seven.h</B>

Or use a <A HREF="editing.html#wildcard">wildcard</A>, like it's used in the shell:

<B>	:args *.txt</B>

Vim will take you to the first file in the <A HREF="eval.html#list">list</A>.  Again, if the current file
has changes, you can either write the file first, or use &quot;:args!&quot; (with !
added) to <A HREF="editing.html#abandon">abandon</A> the changes.


DID YOU EDIT THE LAST FILE?

							*<A NAME="arglist-quit"></A><B>arglist-quit</B>*
When you use a <A HREF="eval.html#list">list</A> of files, Vim assumes you want to edit them all.  To
protect you from exiting too early, you will get this error when you didn't
edit the last file in the <A HREF="eval.html#list">list</A> yet:

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	E173: 46 more files to edit </FONT></B>

If you really want to exit, just <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> again.  Then <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> will work (but not when
you did other commands in between).

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="07.3"></A><B>07.3</B>*	Jumping from file to file

To quickly jump between two files, press <A HREF="editing.html#CTRL-^">CTRL-^</A> (on English-US keyboards the ^
is above the 6 key).  Example:

<B>	:args one.c two.c three.c</B>

You are now in one.c.

<B>	:next</B>

Now you are in two.c.  Now use <A HREF="editing.html#CTRL-^">CTRL-^</A> to go back to one.c.  Another <A HREF="editing.html#CTRL-^">CTRL-^</A> and
you are back in two.c.  Another <A HREF="editing.html#CTRL-^">CTRL-^</A> and you are in one.c again.  If you now
<A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A>:

<B>	:next</B>

You are in three.c.  Notice that the <A HREF="editing.html#CTRL-^">CTRL-^</A> command does not change the idea
of where you are in the <A HREF="eval.html#list">list</A> of files.  Only commands like &quot;<A HREF="editing.html#:next">:next</A>&quot; and
&quot;<A HREF="editing.html#:previous">:previous</A>&quot; <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> that.

The file you were previously editing is called the &quot;alternate&quot; file.  When you
just started Vim <A HREF="editing.html#CTRL-^">CTRL-^</A> will not work, since there isn't a previous file.


PREDEFINED MARKS

After jumping to another file, you can use two predefined marks which are very
useful:

<B>	`"</B>

This takes you to the position where the cursor was when you left the file.
Another <A HREF="motion.html#mark">mark</A> that is remembered is the position where you made the last
change:

<B>	`.</B>

Suppose you are editing the file &quot;one.txt&quot;.  Somewhere halfway through the
file you use &quot;<A HREF="change.html#x">x</A>&quot; to delete a character.  Then you go to the last line with &quot;<A HREF="motion.html#G">G</A>&quot;
and write the file with &quot;<A HREF="editing.html#:w">:w</A>&quot;.  You edit several other files, and then use
&quot;<A HREF="editing.html#:edit">:edit</A> one.txt&quot; to come back to &quot;one.txt&quot;.  If you now use `&quot; Vim jumps to the
last line of the file.  Using <A HREF="motion.html#`.">`.</A> takes you to the position where you deleted
the character.  Even when you move around in the file `&quot; and <A HREF="motion.html#`.">`.</A> will take you
to the remembered position, at least until you make another change or leave
the file.


FILE MARKS

In chapter 4 was explained how you can place a <A HREF="motion.html#mark">mark</A> in a file with &quot;mx&quot; and
jump to that position with &quot;`x&quot;.  That works within one file.  If you edit
another file and place marks there, these are specific for that file.  Thus
each file has its own set of marks, they are local to the file.
   So far we were using marks with a <A HREF="change.html#lowercase">lowercase</A> <A HREF="print.html#letter">letter</A>.  There are also marks
with an <A HREF="change.html#uppercase">uppercase</A> <A HREF="print.html#letter">letter</A>.  These are global, they can be used from any file.
For example suppose that we are editing the file &quot;foo.txt&quot;.  Go to halfway of
the file (&quot;50&#37;&quot;) and place the <A HREF="motion.html#F">F</A> <A HREF="motion.html#mark">mark</A> there (F for foo):

<B>	50%mF</B>

Now edit the file &quot;bar.txt&quot; and place the <A HREF="motion.html#B">B</A> <A HREF="motion.html#mark">mark</A> (B for <A HREF="motion.html#bar">bar</A>) at its last line:

<B>	GmB</B>

Now you can use the &quot;'F&quot; command to jump back to halfway of foo.txt.  Or edit
yet another file, type &quot;'B&quot; and you jump to the end of bar.txt.

The file marks are remembered until they are placed somewhere else.  Thus you
can place the <A HREF="motion.html#mark">mark</A>, <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> hours of editing and still be able to jump back to that
<A HREF="motion.html#mark">mark</A>.
   It's often useful to think of a simple connection between the <A HREF="motion.html#mark">mark</A> <A HREF="print.html#letter">letter</A>
and where <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> is placed.  For example, use the <A HREF="motion.html#H">H</A> <A HREF="motion.html#mark">mark</A> in a header file, <A HREF="motion.html#M">M</A> in
a Makefile and C in a C code file.

To see where a specific <A HREF="motion.html#mark">mark</A> is, give an argument to the &quot;<A HREF="motion.html#:marks">:marks</A>&quot; command:

<B>	:marks M</B>

You can also give several arguments:

<B>	:marks MCP</B>

Don't forget that you can use <A HREF="motion.html#CTRL-O">CTRL-O</A> and <A HREF="motion.html#CTRL-I">CTRL-I</A> to jump to older and newer
positions without placing marks there.

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="07.4"></A><B>07.4</B>*	Backup files

Usually Vim does not produce a <A HREF="editing.html#backup">backup</A> file.  If you want to have one, all you
need to <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> is execute the following command:

<B>	:set backup</B>

The name of the <A HREF="editing.html#backup">backup</A> file is the original file with a  ~  added to the end.
If your file is named data.txt, for example, the <A HREF="editing.html#backup">backup</A> file name is
data.txt~.
   If you <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> not like the fact that the <A HREF="editing.html#backup">backup</A> files end with ~, you can
change the extension:

<B>	:set backupext=.bak</B>

This will use data.txt.bak instead of data.txt~.
   Another option that matters here is <A HREF="options.html#'backupdir'">'backupdir'</A>.  It specifies where the
<A HREF="editing.html#backup">backup</A> file is written.  The default, to write the <A HREF="editing.html#backup">backup</A> in the same
directory <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> the original file, will mostly be the right thing.

	Note:
	When the <A HREF="options.html#'backup'">'backup'</A> option isn't set but the <A HREF="options.html#'writebackup'">'writebackup'</A> is, Vim will
	still create a <A HREF="editing.html#backup">backup</A> file.  However, <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> is deleted <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> soon <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> <A HREF="editing.html#writing">writing</A>
	the file was completed successfully.  This <A HREF="eval.html#functions">functions</A> <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> a safety
	against losing your original file when <A HREF="editing.html#writing">writing</A> fails in some way (disk
	full is the most common cause; being hit by lightning might be
	another, although <A HREF="various.html#less">less</A> common).


KEEPING THE ORIGINAL FILE

If you are editing source files, you might want to keep the file before you
make any changes.  But the <A HREF="editing.html#backup">backup</A> file will be overwritten each time you write
the file.  Thus <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> only contains the previous version, not the first one.
   To make Vim keep the original file, set the <A HREF="options.html#'patchmode'">'patchmode'</A> option.  This
specifies the extension used for the first <A HREF="editing.html#backup">backup</A> of a changed file.  Usually
you would <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> this:

<B>	:set patchmode=.orig</B>

When you now edit the file data.txt for the first time, make changes and write
the file, Vim will keep a copy of the unchanged file under the name
&quot;data.txt.orig&quot;.
   If you make further changes to the file, Vim will notice that
&quot;data.txt.orig&quot; already exists and leave <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> alone.  Further <A HREF="editing.html#backup">backup</A> files will
then be called &quot;data.txt~&quot; (or whatever you specified with <A HREF="options.html#'backupext'">'backupext'</A>).
   If you leave <A HREF="options.html#'patchmode'">'patchmode'</A> empty (that is the default), the original file
will not be kept.

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="07.5"></A><B>07.5</B>*	Copy text between files

This explains how to copy text from one file to another.  Let's start with a
simple example.  Edit the file that contains the text you want to copy.  Move
the cursor to the start of the text and press &quot;<A HREF="visual.html#v">v</A>&quot;.  This starts <A HREF="visual.html#Visual">Visual</A> mode.
Now move the cursor to the end of the text and press &quot;<A HREF="change.html#y">y</A>&quot;.  This yanks (copies)
the selected text.
   To copy the above <A HREF="motion.html#paragraph">paragraph</A>, you would <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A>:

<B>	:edit thisfile</B>
<B>	/This</B>
<B>	vjjjj$y</B>

Now edit the file you want to put the text in.  Move the cursor to the
character where you want the text to appear after.  Use &quot;<A HREF="change.html#p">p</A>&quot; to put the text
there.
<B>	:edit otherfile</B>
<B>	/There</B>
<B>	p</B>

Of course you can use many other commands to <A HREF="change.html#yank">yank</A> the text.  For example, to
select whole lines start <A HREF="visual.html#Visual">Visual</A> mode with &quot;<A HREF="visual.html#V">V</A>&quot;.  Or use <A HREF="visual.html#CTRL-V">CTRL-V</A> to select a
rectangular block.  Or use &quot;<A HREF="change.html#Y">Y</A>&quot; to <A HREF="change.html#yank">yank</A> a single line, &quot;yaw&quot; to yank-a-word,
etc.
   The &quot;<A HREF="change.html#p">p</A>&quot; command puts the text after the cursor.  Use &quot;<A HREF="change.html#P">P</A>&quot; to put the text
before the cursor.  Notice that Vim remembers if you yanked a whole line or a
block, and puts <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> back that way.


USING REGISTERS

When you want to copy several pieces of text from one file to another, having
to switch between the files and <A HREF="editing.html#writing">writing</A> the target file takes a lot of time.
To avoid this, copy each piece of text to its own <A HREF="sponsor.html#register">register</A>.
   A <A HREF="sponsor.html#register">register</A> is a place where Vim stores text.  Here we will use the
<A HREF="change.html#registers">registers</A> named a to <A HREF="vimindex.html#z">z</A> (later you will find out there are others).  Let's copy
a <A HREF="motion.html#sentence">sentence</A> to the <A HREF="motion.html#f">f</A> <A HREF="sponsor.html#register">register</A> (f for First):

<B>	"fyas</B>

The &quot;yas&quot; command yanks a <A HREF="motion.html#sentence">sentence</A> like before.  It's the &quot;<A HREF="motion.html#f">f</A> that tells Vim
the text should be place in the <A HREF="motion.html#f">f</A> <A HREF="sponsor.html#register">register</A>.  This must come just before the
<A HREF="change.html#yank">yank</A> command.
   Now <A HREF="change.html#yank">yank</A> three whole lines to the <A HREF="motion.html#l">l</A> <A HREF="sponsor.html#register">register</A> (l for line):

<B>	"l3Y</B>

The <A HREF="intro.html#count">count</A> could be before the &quot;<A HREF="motion.html#l">l</A> just <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> well.  To <A HREF="change.html#yank">yank</A> a block of text to the
<A HREF="motion.html#b">b</A> (for block) <A HREF="sponsor.html#register">register</A>:

<B>	CTRL-Vjjww"by</B>

Notice that the <A HREF="sponsor.html#register">register</A> specification &quot;<A HREF="motion.html#b">b</A> is just before the &quot;<A HREF="change.html#y">y</A>&quot; command.
This is required.  If you would have put <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> before the &quot;<A HREF="motion.html#w">w</A>&quot; command, <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> would
not have worked.
   Now you have three pieces of text in the <A HREF="motion.html#f">f</A>, <A HREF="motion.html#l">l</A> and <A HREF="motion.html#b">b</A> <A HREF="change.html#registers">registers</A>.  Edit
another file, move around and place the text where you want <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>:

<B>	"fp</B>

Again, the <A HREF="sponsor.html#register">register</A> specification &quot;<A HREF="motion.html#f">f</A> comes before the &quot;<A HREF="change.html#p">p</A>&quot; command.
   You can put the <A HREF="change.html#registers">registers</A> in any order.  And the text stays in the <A HREF="sponsor.html#register">register</A>
until you <A HREF="change.html#yank">yank</A> something else into <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>.  Thus you can put <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> many times <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A>
you like.

When you delete text, you can also specify a <A HREF="sponsor.html#register">register</A>.  Use this to move
several pieces of text around.  For example, to delete-a-word and write <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> in
the <A HREF="motion.html#w">w</A> <A HREF="sponsor.html#register">register</A>:

<B>	"wdaw</B>

Again, the <A HREF="sponsor.html#register">register</A> specification comes before the delete command &quot;<A HREF="change.html#d">d</A>&quot;.


APPENDING TO A FILE

When collecting lines of text into one file, you can use this command:

<B>	:write &gt;&gt; logfile</B>

This will write the text of the current file to the end of &quot;logfile&quot;.  Thus <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>
is appended.  This avoids that you have to copy the lines, edit the log file
and put them there.  Thus you save two steps.  But you can only append to the
end of a file.
   To append only a few lines, select them in <A HREF="visual.html#Visual">Visual</A> mode before typing
&quot;<A HREF="editing.html#:write">:write</A>&quot;.  In chapter 10 you will learn other ways to select a range of lines.

==============================================================================

*<A NAME="07.6"></A><B>07.6</B>*	Viewing a file

Sometimes you only want to see what a file contains, without the intention to
ever write <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> back.  There is the risk that you type &quot;<A HREF="editing.html#:w">:w</A>&quot; without thinking and
overwrite the original file anyway.  To avoid this, edit the file read-only.
   To start Vim in readonly mode, use this command:

<B>	vim -R file</B>

On <A HREF="os_unix.html#Unix">Unix</A> this command should <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> the same thing:

<B>	view file</B>

You are now editing &quot;file&quot; in read-only mode.  When you try using &quot;<A HREF="editing.html#:w">:w</A>&quot; you
will get an error message and the file won't be written.
   When you try to make a change to the file Vim will give you a warning:

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	W10: Warning: Changing a readonly file </FONT></B>

The change will be done though.  This allows for <A HREF="change.html#formatting">formatting</A> the file, for
example, to be able to read <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> easily.
   If you make changes to a file and forgot that <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> was read-only, you can
still write <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A>.  Add the ! to the write command to force <A HREF="editing.html#writing">writing</A>.

If you really want to forbid making changes in a file, <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> this:

<B>	vim -M file</B>

Now every attempt to change the text will fail.  The help files are like this,
for example.  If you try to make a change you get this error message:

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	E21: Cannot make changes, 'modifiable' is off </FONT></B>

You could use the <A HREF="starting.html#-M">-M</A> argument to setup Vim to work in a viewer mode.  This is
only voluntary though, since these commands will remove the protection:

<B>	:set modifiable</B>
<B>	:set write</B>

*<A NAME="07.7"></A><B>07.7</B>*	Changing the file name

A clever way to start editing a new file is by using an existing file that
contains most of what you need.  For example, you start <A HREF="editing.html#writing">writing</A> a new program
to move a file.  You know that you already have a program that copies a file,
thus you start with:

<B>	:edit copy.c</B>

You can delete the stuff you don't need.  Now you need to save the file under
a new name.  The &quot;<A HREF="editing.html#:saveas">:saveas</A>&quot; command can be used for this:

<B>	:saveas move.c</B>

Vim will write the file under the given name, and edit that file.  Thus the
next time you <A HREF="diff.html#do">do</A> &quot;<A HREF="editing.html#:write">:write</A>&quot;, <A HREF="motion.html#it">it</A> will write &quot;move.c&quot;.  &quot;copy.c&quot; remains
unmodified.
   When you want to change the name of the file you are editing, but don't
want to write the file, you can use this command:

<B>	:file move.c</B>

Vim will <A HREF="motion.html#mark">mark</A> the file <A HREF="motion.html#as">as</A> &quot;not edited&quot;.  This means that Vim knows this is not
the file you started editing.  When you try to write the file, you might get
this message:

<B><FONT color="#54A23D">	E13: File exists (use ! to override) </FONT></B>

This protects you from accidentally overwriting another file.
